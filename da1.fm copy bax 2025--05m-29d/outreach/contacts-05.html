            <p>T Bone Burnett is a legendary producer, songwriter, and audio technology innovator who has developed the groundbreaking "Ionic Original" audio format. This revolutionary analog medium is described as "the pinnacle of recorded sound" with unparalleled archival quality and future-proof characteristics. What sets Ionic Originals apart is its ability to embed and preserve rich metadata alongside the audio, addressing a critical problem in the music industry where essential attribution information is frequently lost. Burnett has collaborated with Bob Dylan to showcase this technology, with Dylan re-recording several of his classic songs specifically for the Ionic format. Unlike conventional digital formats that strip away contextual information, Burnett's innovation creates a permanent bond between the music and its metadata, ensuring proper attribution, rights information, and even multimedia elements remain permanently attached to the recording. His work represents a significant step forward in protecting creators' rights and preserving the integrity of musical works in their complete form.</p>

            <p>Benji Rogers is a British-born, New York-based entrepreneur, technologist, and musician who has pioneered innovative solutions to the music industry's metadata challenges. As the founder of PledgeMusic and dotBlockchain Music, Rogers has been at the forefront of using blockchain technology to solve persistent issues with rights management and attribution. His dotBlockchain project aimed to create a new music file format (.bc) that would permanently bind ownership and rights information to the music itself, making it impossible to separate the content from its metadata. This approach addresses the fundamental problem in the music industry where attribution information is routinely stripped away or lost as music travels across platforms. Rogers' vision includes creating what he calls "Minimum Viable Data" for every song, ensuring that at least one writer and one performer can always be identified and contacted. His work has focused on shifting the industry from building databases first to focusing on publishing and embedding critical metadata directly within the music files themselves, creating a decentralized and transparent rights management system that benefits all stakeholders in the music ecosystem.</p>

            <p>Hazel Savage is a music technology veteran who co-founded Musiio, an AI music curation company that revolutionized how music is cataloged and tagged. With over 12 years of industry experience at companies like Shazam, Pandora, and Universal Music, Savage identified a critical gap in the music ecosystem: the inability to efficiently process and tag the massive volume of music being created daily. Musiio's AI technology can "listen" to music and automatically generate accurate metadata tags for genre, BPM, key, vocal characteristics, mood, and recording quality - processing up to 2 million tracks daily with 90-99.9% accuracy per tag. This solves a fundamental problem where producers often upload music without essential metadata, making it nearly impossible for users to discover relevant tracks. Following SoundCloud's acquisition of Musiio in 2022, Savage joined as VP, continuing to advance AI-powered metadata solutions. Her work emphasizes that AI isn't meant to replace human creativity but rather to handle the overwhelming volume of descriptive tagging that would be impossible for humans to manage, ultimately helping every song in a catalog to be properly identified, discovered, and monetized.</p>

            <p>Dae Bogan is a music rights administration expert and technical strategist who founded TuneRegistry to solve the complex challenge of managing music rights metadata. Recognized as Billboard's Digital Power Player and receiving the 2024 Music Business Association's "Maestro of Metadata" Bizzy Award, Bogan created TuneRegistry after experiencing firsthand the daunting process of registering artists' music across multiple platforms. The platform streamlines rights administration by allowing users to organize their music catalog and submit registrations to organizations like ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, SoundExchange, Harry Fox Agency, and data services including Gracenote and TiVo. TuneRegistry helps independent creators properly register their music to ensure they are identified, accounted to, and paid for their work. In 2019, the platform was acquired by Jammber, establishing a full-service solution for both reporting music ownership and managing rights administration. With extensive experience as an independent artist, self-published songwriter, label owner, and now as Head of Third-Party Partnerships at The Mechanical Licensing Collective (The MLC), Bogan brings deep expertise in addressing the metadata challenges that have plagued the music industry, particularly for independent artists and rights holders.</p>
