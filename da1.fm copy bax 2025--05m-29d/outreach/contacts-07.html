            <p>Björn Ulvaeus, best known as a member of ABBA, launched the Credits Due initiative in collaboration with The Ivors Academy and The Music Rights Awareness Foundation (which he co-founded). The initiative, unveiled at the Ivor Novello awards in September 2021, aims to ensure that complete and accurate song metadata is attached to all recordings at the point of creation. Ulvaeus has highlighted that approximately £500 million ($625 million) in royalties is unallocated or misallocated each year worldwide due to missing and incomplete metadata. The Credits Due initiative proposes that all new recordings and songs include five key metadata elements: song titles (including alternative titles), musical work identifiers, creator identifiers and role codes, recording identifiers, and details of all contributors. The problem is growing more acute with 60,000 new tracks added to Spotify daily. Ulvaeus serves as the President of CISAC (International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers) and co-founder of The Music Rights Awareness Foundation (MRAF).</p>

            "A lot of people think I want WAV files, but they don't hold any metadata, so they're kind of useless."
            <div class="quote-source">Source: Cited in industry discussions on metadata, https://community.metabrainz.org/t/metadata-is-the-biggest-little-problem-plaguing-the-music-industry/430027</div>

            <p>Alison Moses is a music supervisor who has highlighted a critical issue with WAV files in the music industry - their inability to hold persistent metadata. This technical limitation creates significant workflow challenges for music supervisors, who need accurate and complete metadata to properly organize, search, and license music for film, television, and other media projects. Moses's frustration is "often shared by music journalists, music supervisors and really anyone who's sent music in bulk, as improper or missing metadata can seriously impact their ability to engage with a piece of music—even when they like what they hear." The issue she identifies is particularly problematic because WAV files are considered the industry standard for high-quality audio, yet they're among "the most egregious offenders when it comes to missing information." This technical disconnect between audio quality and metadata preservation creates a fundamental challenge in the music licensing workflow.</p>
