            <p>Björn Ulvaeus, best known as a member of ABBA, launched the Credits Due initiative in collaboration with The Ivors Academy and The Music Rights Awareness Foundation (which he co-founded). The initiative, unveiled at the Ivor Novello awards in September 2021, aims to ensure that complete and accurate song metadata is attached to all recordings at the point of creation. Ulvaeus has highlighted that approximately £500 million ($625 million) in royalties is unallocated or misallocated each year worldwide due to missing and incomplete metadata. The Credits Due initiative proposes that all new recordings and songs include five key metadata elements: song titles (including alternative titles), musical work identifiers, creator identifiers and role codes, recording identifiers, and details of all contributors. The problem is growing more acute with 60,000 new tracks added to Spotify daily. Ulvaeus serves as the President of CISAC (International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers) and co-founder of The Music Rights Awareness Foundation (MRAF).</p>

Under his leadership, BISG has developed and promoted metadata best practices and standards like ONIX for Books, which facilitates the communication of book industry product information in electronic form.
