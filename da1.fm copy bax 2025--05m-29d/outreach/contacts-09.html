    <p>T Bone Burnett is a legendary producer, songwriter, and audio technology innovator who has developed the groundbreaking "Ionic Original" audio format. This revolutionary analog medium is described as "the pinnacle of recorded sound" with unparalleled archival quality and future-proof characteristics. What sets Ionic Originals apart is its ability to embed and preserve rich metadata alongside the audio, addressing a critical problem in the music industry where essential attribution information is frequently lost. Burnett has collaborated with Bob Dylan to showcase this technology, with Dylan re-recording several of his classic songs specifically for the Ionic format. Unlike conventional digital formats that strip away contextual information, Burnett's innovation creates a permanent bond between the music and its metadata, ensuring proper attribution, rights information, and even multimedia elements remain permanently attached to the recording. His work represents a significant step forward in protecting creators' rights and preserving the integrity of musical works in their complete form.</p>

    <p>Benji Rogers is a British-born, New York-based entrepreneur, technologist, and musician who has pioneered innovative solutions to the music industry's metadata challenges. As the founder of PledgeMusic and dotBlockchain Music, Rogers has been at the forefront of using blockchain technology to solve persistent issues with rights management and attribution. His dotBlockchain project aimed to create a new music file format (.bc) that would permanently bind ownership and rights information to the music itself, making it impossible to separate the content from its metadata. This approach addresses the fundamental problem in the music industry where attribution information is routinely stripped away or lost as music travels across platforms. Rogers' vision includes creating what he calls "Minimum Viable Data" for every song, ensuring that at least one writer and one performer can always be identified and contacted. His work has focused on shifting the industry from building databases first to focusing on publishing and embedding critical metadata directly within the music files themselves, creating a decentralized and transparent rights management system that benefits all stakeholders in the music ecosystem.</p>

    <p>Hazel Savage is a music technology veteran who co-founded Musiio, an AI music curation company that revolutionized how music is cataloged and tagged. With over 12 years of industry experience at companies like Shazam, Pandora, and Universal Music, Savage identified a critical gap in the music ecosystem: the inability to efficiently process and tag the massive volume of music being created daily. Musiio's AI technology can "listen" to music and automatically generate accurate metadata tags for genre, BPM, key, vocal characteristics, mood, and recording quality - processing up to 2 million tracks daily with 90-99.9% accuracy per tag. This solves a fundamental problem where producers often upload music without essential metadata, making it nearly impossible for users to discover relevant tracks. Following SoundCloud's acquisition of Musiio in 2022, Savage joined as VP, continuing to advance AI-powered metadata solutions. Her work emphasizes that AI isn't meant to replace human creativity but rather to handle the overwhelming volume of descriptive tagging that would be impossible for humans to manage, ultimately helping every song in a catalog to be properly identified, discovered, and monetized.</p>

    <p>Dae Bogan is a music rights administration expert and technical strategist who founded TuneRegistry to solve the complex challenge of managing music rights metadata. Recognized as Billboard's Digital Power Player and receiving the 2024 Music Business Association's "Maestro of Metadata" Bizzy Award, Bogan created TuneRegistry after experiencing firsthand the daunting process of registering artists' music across multiple platforms. The platform streamlines rights administration by allowing users to organize their music catalog and submit registrations to organizations like ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, SoundExchange, Harry Fox Agency, and data services including Gracenote and TiVo. TuneRegistry helps independent creators properly register their music to ensure they are identified, accounted to, and paid for their work. In 2019, the platform was acquired by Jammber, establishing a full-service solution for both reporting music ownership and managing rights administration. With extensive experience as an independent artist, self-published songwriter, label owner, and now as Head of Third-Party Partnerships at The Mechanical Licensing Collective (The MLC), Bogan brings deep expertise in addressing the metadata challenges that have plagued the music industry, particularly for independent artists and rights holders.</p>

In discussing his evolution as an artist, Questlove has stated: "In the 2000s, I became an artist. I started preserving and educating. I became more obsessed with making iPod playlists for people." His books, documentary work, and public statements reflect a deep respect for musical history and the importance of documenting and contextualizing it properly. His famous quote "When you live your life through records, the records are a record of your life" encapsulates his philosophy that music not only documents history broadly but also serves as a personal archive of one's experiences.</p>

    <p>Björn Ulvaeus, best known as a member of ABBA, launched the Credits Due initiative in collaboration with The Ivors Academy and The Music Rights Awareness Foundation (which he co-founded). The initiative, unveiled at the Ivor Novello awards in September 2021, aims to ensure that complete and accurate song metadata is attached to all recordings at the point of creation. Ulvaeus has highlighted that approximately £500 million ($625 million) in royalties is unallocated or misallocated each year worldwide due to missing and incomplete metadata. The Credits Due initiative proposes that all new recordings and songs include five key metadata elements: song titles (including alternative titles), musical work identifiers, creator identifiers and role codes, recording identifiers, and details of all contributors. The problem is growing more acute with 60,000 new tracks added to Spotify daily. Ulvaeus serves as the President of CISAC (International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers) and co-founder of The Music Rights Awareness Foundation (MRAF).</p>

    <p>Alison Moses is a music supervisor who has highlighted a critical issue with WAV files in the music industry - their inability to hold persistent metadata. This technical limitation creates significant workflow challenges for music supervisors, who need accurate and complete metadata to properly organize, search, and license music for film, television, and other media projects. Moses's frustration is "often shared by music journalists, music supervisors and really anyone who's sent music in bulk, as improper or missing metadata can seriously impact their ability to engage with a piece of music—even when they like what they hear." The issue she identifies is particularly problematic because WAV files are considered the industry standard for high-quality audio, yet they're among "the most egregious offenders when it comes to missing information." This technical disconnect between audio quality and metadata preservation creates a fundamental challenge in the music licensing workflow.</p>
