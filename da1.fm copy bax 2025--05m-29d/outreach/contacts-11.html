Throughout his career, which included roles at Digital First Media, the American Press Institute, and Louisiana State University, Buttry advocated for journalistic practices that maintained clear connections between information and its sources. While his focus was primarily on attribution in the text of news stories, his work has broader implications for metadata in digital journalism, highlighting how proper source information is essential for maintaining credibility and enabling fact-checking. Buttry was particularly attentive to how digital platforms were changing journalistic practices, emphasizing the need for attribution standards that could adapt to new media formats while maintaining core principles of transparency and accountability.
