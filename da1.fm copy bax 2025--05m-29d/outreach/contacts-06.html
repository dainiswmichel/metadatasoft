So we can store Blu-ray discs on the disc; we can store holograms; we can store metadata. It's possible that we would be able to store a film of the record on the disc, so that while you listen to the disc in analog, you can see the film of the disc on your screen."

            "When describing the quality that raises analog sound above digital sound, the word 'warmth' is often used. Analog sound has more depth, more harmonic complexity, more resonance, better imaging. Analog sound has more feel, more character, more touch. Digital sound is frozen. Analog sound is alive."

            <p>T Bone Burnett is a legendary producer, songwriter, and audio technology innovator who has developed the groundbreaking "Ionic Original" audio format. This new analog medium is described as "the pinnacle of recorded sound" with unparalleled archival quality and future-proof characteristics. What sets Ionic Originals apart is its ability to embed and preserve rich metadata alongside the audio, addressing a critical problem in the music industry where essential attribution information is frequently lost. Burnett has been highly critical of how tech companies have treated musicians: "The surveillance capitalists confiscated our stuff first. They took our music and said, information wants to be free, so we're just going to take your music for free." He believes artists should regain control of their work in the digital age: "This really started because recorded music has been commoditized to zero over the last 20-30 years... in this case, we have taken matters into our own hands, and we control the means of production and we control the copyright."</p>

            "Artists should have some say in what the deals are, where they are, and for how long. There needs to be transparency: Artists should have access to data on their streaming income in a way that's comprehensible."

            "The PROs [Performance Rights Organizations] are non-profits—and are therefore completely transparent: any artists can see their money flow. With the giant publishers, this transparency disappears completely—all deals and money flow are secret...which makes many of us suspicious."

            <p>David Byrne is an influential musician, author, and advocate for artists' rights in the digital age. He has been outspoken about the need for transparency in music streaming and data access for artists. Byrne has noted significant conflicts of interest in the music industry: "Yes, the streaming companies 'negotiate' with labels — but the (big) labels are investors, which is clearly a conflict of interest... The labels therefore have no incentive to get tough with the streaming companies — very, very clever." While Byrne doesn't specifically use the term "metadata" in all his quotes, he is addressing the crucial role of data transparency in the digital music ecosystem, where proper metadata ensures both discovery and compensation. His advocacy for transparency and artist control aligns perfectly with the importance of properly managed metadata in today's digital music landscape.</p>

            "Music has the power to stop time. When I listen to songs, I'm transported back to the moment of their birth, which is sometimes even before the moment of my birth. Old songs, rock or soul or blues, still connect with me because the human emotions in them, whether jealousy or rage or hope, are recognizably similar to the emotions that I'm feeling now."

            <p>Questlove (Ahmir Khalib Thompson) is a drummer, DJ, producer, and co-founder of The Roots who has become an influential voice on music preservation and cultural documentation. While not explicitly using the term "metadata" in many public statements, his work as a DJ, producer, and cultural historian demonstrates his commitment to preserving musical heritage and ensuring proper attribution for artists. In discussing his evolution as an artist, Questlove has stated: "In the 2000s, I became an artist. I started preserving and educating. I became more obsessed with making iPod playlists for people." His books, documentary work, and public statements reflect a deep respect for musical history and the importance of documenting and contextualizing it properly. His famous quote "When you live your life through records, the records are a record of your life" encapsulates his philosophy that music not only documents history broadly but also serves as a personal archive of one's experiences.</p>
