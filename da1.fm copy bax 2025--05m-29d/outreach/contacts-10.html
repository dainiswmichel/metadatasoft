            <p>Imogen Heap is an innovative, Grammy-winning musician and technology pioneer who has been at the forefront of creative rights in the digital age. She founded Mycelia, a research and development hub for music makers that uses blockchain technology to create a sustainable music industry ecosystem. Heap's vision is centered around her concept of "Creative Passports" - a digital container for verified profile information, IDs, works, business partners, and payment mechanisms for each musician. In 2015, Heap made headlines with her song "Tiny Human," which she released using Ethereum blockchain technology to demonstrate how smart contracts could automate payments to everyone involved in creating the song. Her work focuses on empowering musicians through better metadata and rights management, allowing for more direct relationships with fans and fairer compensation for their work. Heap's advocacy extends to public speaking, including her TED talk on how blockchain could support musicians. She continues to develop innovative approaches to embedding and preserving metadata in creative works.</p>
