        <div class="quote">
            <p>"Many, many digital photo creators don't even know that metadata can be saved within an image file."</p>
            <p>For professional photographers, embedded metadata is "an easy way to let potential publishers know they took the photo and how to contact them. Storing this information inside the image can't prevent others from misusing the information but it can help others know more about the image: who is pictured in a photo, what they are doing (and maybe why) as well as where and when it was taken. However, all of those benefits are lost if this metadata doesn't 'stick' to the image as it travels from one computer to another and onto the web."</p>
            <p>"Metadata acts as contextual agent, documenting the 'who, what, where, when, why, and how', and gives an image identity and authenticity. Once data about the image is removed much of its meaning is lost. This can lead to unfortunate consequences. Under an act recently passed in the UK these orphaned photos could be used by for-profit companies without the consent of the copyright holder(s)."</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>David Riecks (rhymes with "clicks") is a professional photographer, digital-image technologist, and metadata evangelist who has been heavily involved in promoting and developing photo metadata standards. He chaired the Digital Photography Standards & Practices committees of the American Society of Media Photographers (ASMP) and was a founding member of the Universal Photographic Digital Imaging Guidelines coalition.</p>

        <div class="quote">
            <p>"There are 'lots of organizations creating schemas, and many of their properties are quite similar in terms of semantics.' The problem: there are reasonable schemas for different areas of creative work in a given area, but 'looking across boundaries it is hard to bring them together.'"</p>
            <p>"Much time and money is spent to protect metadata in in-house systems... Therefore it is a business requirement to protect the descriptive data and rights information from getting lost."</p>
            <p>"There are many important reasons to embed and preserve metadata – to protect copyrights, ensure proper licensing, track image use, smooth workflow, and make them searchable on- or offline. If users provide captions, dates, a copyright notice and the creator within their images, that data shouldn't be removed when sharing them on social media websites without their knowledge."</p>
            <p>"The quality assurance of these sites might not be aware that their software strips metadata inadvertently."</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Michael Steidl served as Managing Director of IPTC for 15 years. He was responsible for the wide-ranging work of the IPTC, an organization deeply involved in the development and use of metadata standards for 35 years. Under his leadership, IPTC conducted studies on metadata preservation across social media platforms and advocated for better metadata preservation practices.</p>

        <p>Jeff Sedlik is a photographer, director, educator, publisher, and consultant who serves as President of the PLUS Coalition. He is recognized as a leading expert on image licensing, copyright, and the business of photography. As a past National President of the APA (Advertising Photographers of America), he has been extensively involved in advocating for photographers' rights.</p>
        
        <p>The PLUS Coalition, under Sedlik's leadership, has worked to address the "complete lack of respect for photographer credits and copyrights" where "metadata is regularly stripped in its entirety." This forces photographers who care about their copyrights and ownership to place their metadata offline, separate from their photos.</p>
