            <div class="body">Dear [Director's Name],

I'm reaching out to just ten institutions worldwide, each with a proven commitment to preserving cultural memory with care and integrity.

You are one of them.

This message is to invite the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum to reserve what will become the first-ever DA1 container — a structured digital capsule engineered for long-term metadata integrity, creative attribution, and the immutable preservation of testimonies, works, and truths.

In the upcoming 2025 DA1 Digital Time Capsule, there will be exactly 2,025 containers. These containers are timestamped, structured, and sealed with clear provenance.

While DA1 as a platform will continue to grow, these 2,025 containers in the 2025 time capsule are historically bounded and culturally significant.

The mission of the Holocaust Memorial Museum aligns perfectly with the core values of DA1: ensuring that vital testimony and historical truth remains intact and accessible across time, technological disruption, and political change. In a world where digital content is increasingly vulnerable to manipulation, erasure, or loss of attribution, DA1 offers a structurally sound alternate path.

We are offering the first container in this capsule for $100,000, and this opportunity is being extended exclusively to ten institutions. After that, container reservations will open to the public at standard tiers ($10,000, $1,000, and so on).

If the Museum is interested in securing this place in digital preservation history, please respond by [date]. From that point, the container will go to whoever commits first.

I'd be honored to discuss how the Museum's archives, testimonies, or survivor metadata might be represented within this first-ever DA1 capsule.

Thank you for everything you already do to protect memory.

            <div class="body">Dear Brewster,

I'm reaching out to just ten institutions worldwide, each with a proven commitment to preserving digital memory.

The Internet Archive is at the top of that list.

This message is to invite you to reserve what will become the first-ever DA1 container — a structured digital capsule engineered for long-term metadata integrity, creative attribution, and the immutable preservation of digital works.

In the upcoming 2025 DA1 Digital Time Capsule, there will be exactly 2,025 containers. These containers are timestamped, structured, and sealed with clear provenance.

I believe DA1's approach complements the Archive's mission perfectly. While the Wayback Machine preserves snapshots of content, DA1 containers add a persistent layer of structured metadata and attribution that remains intact across migrations and transformations.

We are offering the first container in this capsule for $100,000, and this opportunity is being extended exclusively to ten institutions. After that, container reservations will open to the public at standard tiers ($10,000, $1,000, and so on).

No one understands digital preservation better than you and your team. I'd be honored to discuss how the Internet Archive might utilize DA1 containers to further your mission of "Universal Access to All Knowledge" by ensuring that knowledge maintains its integrity and attribution through time.

If you're interested in securing this place in digital preservation history, please respond by [date]. From that point, the container will go to whoever commits first.

I believe the Library of Congress, with its commitment to preserving America's cultural memory, would be an ideal steward of the first DA1 container. This system was designed with the exact challenges in mind that your team navigates daily: format obsolescence, metadata decay, and attribution integrity.

            <div class="body">Dear [Director/Curator's Name],

I'm reaching out to just ten institutions worldwide with pioneering approaches to preserving digital creativity.

MoMA's leadership in this space is unparalleled.

This message is to invite MoMA to reserve what will become the first-ever DA1 container — a structured digital capsule engineered for long-term metadata integrity, creative attribution, and the immutable preservation of digital and new media art.

In the upcoming 2025 DA1 Digital Time Capsule, there will be exactly 2,025 containers. These containers are timestamped, structured, and sealed with clear provenance.

While DA1 as a platform will continue to grow, these 2,025 containers in the 2025 time capsule are historically bounded and culturally significant.

I believe MoMA, with its outstanding collection of digital art and media works, would be an ideal steward of the first DA1 container. This system was designed with the unique challenges of digital art preservation in mind: maintaining attribution, preserving relationships to tools and contexts, and ensuring works remain experienceable despite technological change.

We are offering the first container in this capsule for $100,000, and this opportunity is being extended exclusively to ten institutions. After that, container reservations will open to the public at standard tiers ($10,000, $1,000, and so on).

If MoMA is interested in securing this place in digital preservation history, please respond by [date]. From that point, the container will go to whoever commits first.

I'd be honored to discuss how MoMA's digital and new media collections might be represented within this first-ever DA1 capsule, potentially creating a model for future art preservation efforts.

Thank you for your institution's pioneering work in digital art curation.

            <div class="body">Dear [Executive's Name],

I'm reaching out to just ten institutions worldwide with exceptional commitments to democratic access to knowledge.

The New York Public Library stands as a beacon of this mission.

This message is to invite NYPL to reserve what will become the first-ever DA1 container — a structured digital capsule engineered for long-term metadata integrity, creative attribution, and the immutable preservation of public knowledge resources.

In the upcoming 2025 DA1 Digital Time Capsule, there will be exactly 2,025 containers. These containers are timestamped, structured, and sealed with clear provenance.

While DA1 as a platform will continue to grow, these 2,025 containers in the 2025 time capsule are historically bounded and culturally significant.

I believe NYPL, with its commitment to both preservation and innovation, would be an ideal steward of the first DA1 container. This system aligns perfectly with your mission of maintaining public access to knowledge across generations and technological change.

We are offering the first container in this capsule for $100,000, and this opportunity is being extended exclusively to ten institutions. After that, container reservations will open to the public at standard tiers ($10,000, $1,000, and so on).

If NYPL is interested in securing this place in digital preservation history, please respond by [date]. From that point, the container will go to whoever commits first.

I'd be honored to discuss how NYPL's digital collections—perhaps focusing on New York's cultural heritage or your most at-risk digital materials—might be represented within this first-ever DA1 capsule.

Thank you for your institution's leadership in public knowledge access.

I'm reaching out to just ten institutions worldwide with the most significant mandates for permanent records preservation.

The National Archives and Records Administration stands at the foundation of this mission for the United States.

This message is to invite NARA to reserve what will become the first-ever DA1 container — a structured digital capsule engineered for long-term metadata integrity, attribution persistence, and the immutable preservation of federal records.

I believe NARA, with its critical responsibility for preserving America's documentary heritage, would be an ideal steward of the first DA1 container. This system was designed to address many of the challenges NARA navigates in the digital era: ensuring records remain authentic, attributable, and accessible despite technological change.

We are offering the first container in this capsule for $100,000, and this opportunity is being extended exclusively to ten institutions. After that, container reservations will open to the public at standard tiers ($10,000, $1,000, and so on).

I'd be honored to discuss how select federal records might be represented within this first-ever DA1 capsule, potentially creating a model for future government digital preservation efforts.

            <div class="subject">Subject: Invitation to Reserve the First DA1 Container - Attribution Persistence</div>
            <div class="body">Dear [Executive's Name],

I'm reaching out to just ten organizations worldwide with exceptional commitments to creative attribution.

Creative Commons stands as the global leader in this essential work.

This message is to invite Creative Commons to reserve what will become the first-ever DA1 container — a structured digital capsule engineered for long-term metadata integrity, creative attribution, and the immutable preservation of licensing information.

In the upcoming 2025 DA1 Digital Time Capsule, there will be exactly 2,025 containers. These containers are timestamped, structured, and sealed with clear provenance.

While DA1 as a platform will continue to grow, these 2,025 containers in the 2025 time capsule are historically bounded and culturally significant.

I believe Creative Commons, with its foundational work in open licensing and attribution, would be an ideal steward of the first DA1 container. This system was designed to solve a problem at the heart of your mission: ensuring that attribution and licensing information remains persistently attached to creative works despite technological change.

We are offering the first container in this capsule for $100,000, and this opportunity is being extended exclusively to ten organizations. After that, container reservations will open to the public at standard tiers ($10,000, $1,000, and so on).

If Creative Commons is interested in securing this place in digital preservation history, please respond by [date]. From that point, the container will go to whoever commits first.

I'd be honored to discuss how Creative Commons might utilize this container to preserve crucial aspects of the open licensing ecosystem or demonstrate the value of persistent attribution.

Thank you for your organization's vital work protecting creative attribution.

Respectfully,
Dainis Michel
