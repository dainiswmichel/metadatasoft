We're in a great industrial transition again, and usually when that happens, the content workers get the short end of the stick until this stuff gets sorted out."

            <p>David Lowery has been a vocal advocate for musicians' rights in the digital age. As a professor of economics and finance of the music business at the University of Georgia, he has issued influential essays on musicians' rights and has taken legal action against streaming services for inadequate royalty payments. In 2015, he filed a class-action lawsuit against Spotify, seeking at least $150 million in damages for unpaid mechanical royalties due to inadequate metadata systems. The lawsuit highlighted the disconnect between publishing/songwriting metadata and recording metadata that prevented proper compensation.</p>

As CISAC president and co-founder of The Music Rights Awareness Foundation (MRAF), he has highlighted that approximately £500 million (about $625 million) in royalties goes unallocated or is misallocated each year due to missing and incomplete metadata. He has worked with Max Martin and Niclas Molinder to develop "Session Studio," a technology that automatically captures song metadata during the creation process.</p>

She has testified before Congress on DMCA shortcomings, emphasizing the need for platforms to maintain metadata integrity and implement better fingerprinting technology. Her advocacy influenced her double-album "Data Lords" (2020), which addressed themes of digital control and exploitation.</p>

            <p>T Bone Burnett has been an advocate for audio quality and proper artist control throughout his career. He developed the CODE format in the early 2000s to offer higher-quality audio that preserved the artist's intent. More recently, he unveiled the Ionic Original format, which combines analog sound quality with the ability to embed digital metadata. His advocacy stems from concerns about how digital distribution has stripped artists of control over how their work is presented and how it sounds, emphasizing that records are important cultural documents that should maintain their integrity.</p>
