Dear Young Man,

Don’t Be the Simp Who Saves Her From Her Own Chaos



Let me paint you a picture. She’s over 30, worn out from years of reckless living, and now scrambling to reset her life. Her body count rivals the population of a small town, and her character is non-existent. She’s self-centered, manipulative, and thrives on drama. Financially, she’s a disaster—broke, directionless, yet entitled enough to believe she deserves a good, rich, responsible young man to marry. And here’s the kicker: after wasting her prime years on meaningless flings and chasing chaos, she’s now looking for a bailout.

Men, don’t be that guy. Don’t fall into the trap of believing it’s your duty to “rescue” her. You’ve worked too hard, sacrificed too much, and built your life from the ground up. She isn’t looking for love; she’s looking for a retirement plan. Let me break it down for you so you can see this charade for what it really is.

First, her past choices define her present reality. For years, she prioritized the fast life—ignoring discipline, responsibility, and self-respect. She chose men who treated her like a disposable commodity, and she reveled in the thrill of living without consequences. Now, the results of those choices have caught up with her. But instead of taking accountability, she wants you, the man who has spent years grinding and sacrificing, to clean up her mess. That’s not love or partnership—it’s opportunism.

Second, bad character doesn’t magically improve with age. A woman who’s spent her life being selfish, irresponsible, and combative won’t suddenly transform into a supportive partner because she’s desperate. Toxicity doesn’t fade—it evolves. The same manipulation, drama, and chaos she brought into every past relationship will poison your peace and your home. She’s not looking to build with you; she’s looking to leech off your stability. Don’t mistake her desperation for genuine change.

Third, entitlement is a massive red flag. She’s broke but acts like the world owes her something. She expects you to swoop in and save her, not because she’s earned your effort, but because she believes she’s entitled to it. That entitlement will bleed into every aspect of your relationship. No matter how much you give, it will never be enough. She’ll always want more—your money, your time, your emotional labor—while contributing nothing of value.

And let’s address the elephant in the room: a high body count comes with heavy baggage. This isn’t about morality; it’s about patterns. A woman who has treated relationships as disposable isn’t equipped to value real commitment. Her past is a map of her priorities, and those priorities didn’t include building anything meaningful. That baggage doesn’t just vanish. It becomes your problem the moment you let her into your life.

Make no mistake—she doesn’t want you. She wants what you can provide. Stability. Resources. A sense of security she could never create on her own. You’re not her partner; you’re her escape plan. After years of poor choices, she sees you as her lifeline. And the second things get tough, inconvenient, or less exciting, she’ll discard you like she has every other man before you.

Good, rich, responsible men don’t owe anyone a bailout. You’ve spent your life building yourself into a man of value. Don’t let guilt, manipulation, or lust make you forget your worth. You’re not obligated to sacrifice your peace, your resources, or your future for someone who didn’t value her own life until it was too late.

Instead, prioritize your standards and stick to them. Don’t settle for less just because society, your family, or even your loneliness pressures you to. A woman with discipline, ambition, and character will respect and build with you—not leech off you. Stay focused on your goals and keep your purpose at the forefront of your life. Your mission comes first, and no one has the right to derail it.

Learn to walk away. Strength isn’t just about what you can build; it’s about knowing when to say “no” to what doesn’t serve you. Protect your peace, your time, and your legacy.

At the end of the day, men, your value doesn’t lie in being someone’s safety net. You’ve worked too hard to become the man you are. Don’t throw it all away for someone who spent years living recklessly, only to now expect you to clean up the mess. Be sharp. Be wise. And most importantly, don’t be the unfortunate simp who sacrifices his empire for someone who never cared to build her own.

Stay wise..

Aivis Vasiļevskis
Par Timmu.
Esiet sveicināti, mīļie draugi. Šodienas ieraksts ir veltīts mazliet skumjām pārdomām par to, kas notiek ar mums, ar cilvēkiem, ar tā saucamo 'sabiedrību'.
Kā zināms, tad šodien parādījās sēru vēsts par to, ka Maskavā acīmredzot pašnāvību izdarījis kādreizējais LV basketbola izlases spēlētājs Jānis Timma. Tikai 32 gadu vecumā un ar potenciālu turpināt karjeru vēl gadiem. Kāds tam īsti ir iemesls, kāda bija viņa personiskā traģēdija - apmēram to var nojaust no soctīklu ierakstiem un kopējā dzīves stāsta, bet šajā gadījumā svarīgāks ir kas cits.
Tagad katrs medijs publicē šo ziņu un izsaka līdzjūtību. Taču vēl tikai pirms mēneša tie bija pilni ar ķengu rakstiem par Jāņa izvēli spēlēt Krievijā. Kas tikai viņš nebija dažādu 'eksperdu' slēdzienos - nodevējs, jukušais, neprātis, slims un kas tik ne. Uz mūžiem nolādēts un izslēgts no izlases utt.
Katrs šīs slimās 'sabiedrības'  loceklis varēja atkal izpausties pēc pilnas programmas, zākāties un lamāt cilvēku, kas viņam neko nav sliktu izdarījis, kas ir pārstāvējis šo valsti sportā un tad gan bija pietiekoši labs un vajadzīgs.
Tagad daudzi no tiem lej savas krokodila asaras, taču patieso dabu noslēpt ar to nevar. Patiesu līdzjūtību Jānim var izteikt tikai tie, kas atbalstīja viņu visā, gan LV izlasē, gan Krievijas klubā, nevis divkosīgi izvēlas tikai sev patīkamo. 
Šis notikums skaudri parāda to, ka lielākās 'sabiedrības' daļas īstenais 'latviskums' ir tieši šāds - akls naids, vienaldzība un divkosība. Varam karot ar tautībām, uzspiest vienīgo valodu, zāģēt pieminekļus un visā vainot 'padomju mantojumu', bet realitāte ir tajā, ka nekādas varas, iekārtas un laiks nav spējis mainīt to, kas šī 'sabiedrība' īsti ir. Ka visi šie 'eksperdi' un 'viedokļa paudēji' un mediji, kas to visu uzpūta teju kā nacionālu nodevību, ir ļoti lielā mērā vainojami cilvēka nāvē. Tā mēs atbalstam savējos? Tad paldies, ar šādiem draugiem ienaidniekus nevajag.
Neviens to negribēs atzīt, bet tā ir. Tik svarīgi bija atkal sajaukt kopā savus politiskās propagandas naratīvus un pasludināt kādu par vainīgu, lai kārtējo reizi piesegtu savu stulbumu, korumpētību un melus. Tam bija veltīti veseli raidījumi un studijas. Tika uzstrādāts vesels naida vilnis, ko cilvēks vienkārši nespēj izturēt. Tam nez no kurienes atradās nauda, resursi, tajā ieguldījās visi. Lai cilvēku likvidētu, nevis izprastu un atbalstītu. Kurš tagad gribēs pārstāvēt valsti, nest karogu, būt patriots? Pēc visa šī?  Laikam tikai morāli kropļi. 
Kā to Merķelis reiz par latviešiem aprakstīja, tā viss arī paliek spēkā. Varam klāt pievienot vēl nupat izskanējušo Akropoles Pringles kaudzes izgrābšanu un redzam, ka arī nekad briesmīgos padomju laikus nepieredzējusī jaunā paaudze ir tikpat naska "rietumu vērtībās" Tur ASV lielveikalu iznešana dienas laikā sen ir absolūti ierasta parādība.
Nezinu, vai šis notikums kaut kādā veidā satricinās šo naidpilno 'sabiedrību', vai mediji beigs kurināt naidu un melot. Droši vien, ka nē, jo šīs lietas tāpat saprot tikai tie, kam tāda sirdsapziņa vispār ir.  Acīmredzot, ka medijos notiek rūpīga atlase un tur strādā tikai tie, kam tādas nav.
Šobrīd Jānis ir labākā vietā par šo. Mēs pārējie varam tikai kārtējo reizi piefiksēt un mācīties. 
Spēja pielāgoties slimai sabiedrībai nav veselības mērs. /Krišnamurti/

Dainis W. Michel Are you really trying to say that the subjugation of the female sex has been justified because the male sex didn't let us all go extinct by allowing the females to get eaten by wild animals...? Wow, what a primitive line of thought...

Jenna Rowsell Are you really calling protection and care "subjugation?" Men filling their natural responsibilities with love and effort is "oppression?"
Do you really have no gratitude whatsoever for the water in your tap, the functioning of your toilet, the electricity you use, the roads you drive on and the buildings you inhabit? Seriously?
I'd argue that there is a point at which lack of compassion or gratitude or care -- just becomes malicious and cruel -- do you agree?
Do you even "feel" the cruelty that you radiate? Have you checked in with the men in your life? Do you know what it feels like to have the accomplishments of your gender belittled in every way possible? Now you're calling me primitive. I have 2 Bachelor's degrees and one equivalency, a Master's Degree and am all but dissertation for my Doctorate -- and the only reason I don't have a doctorate is because I single handedly raised my daughter while my xWife terrorized us with female entitlement.
And I mean TERRORIZED.
But my line of thinking is primitive. Sure - if there is any hope that you can reshape your life into one of compassion and care - please do so - otherwise just avoid caring humans altogether...because most people don't portion out care/compassion based on gender -- and most sane people have an accurate understanding of history regarding gender differences.

When “how low can you go” isn't about limbo, but about human stupidy.



JP man, I went vegan for a very good reason and it's been amazing. Especially how wild animals treat me and neighborhood pets. It's an incredible experience and one that may actually be a part of your future, depending on how things go with your health. I've been a fan of yours for a while, but I'm not even going to watch this video all the way through. 

There is nothing "ridiculous" about wanting to eat comforting plant-based foods. Do you really think it's cool to ridicule people who've made their dietary choices out of medical necessity, love for the planet, or an accurate assessment of human physiology?

@AaronSiriSG

Pfizer board member, @ScottGottliebMD, you look foolish attacking 
@RobertKennedyJr
 on CNBC (links to clips below) because it’s clear you lack basic knowledge regarding vaccines. For example:

     --Your claim that in “early 2000s … FDA reformulate[d] the existing MMR vaccine to take some of the preservatives out,” is false. Never happened. You are likely thinking about the removal of thimerosal in the early 2000s from various vaccines but as even CDC explains, “Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccines do not and never did contain thimerosal.” https://cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/thimerosal.html…

     --Your claim that a child “can’t get vaccinated [for MMR] until age 2” is simply false. MMR is routinely given at one year of age and sometimes even earlier. https://cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/index.html…

     --Your claims regarding pertussis vaccines nonsensically ignore the fact that these products do not prevent transmission of the pertussis bacteria – they only provide, at best, personal protection. As a recent consensus paper of industry pertussis vaccine “experts” explained, “aPVs [pertussis vaccine] … cannot avoid infection and transmission. … aPV pertussis vaccines do not prevent colonization. Consequently, they do not reduce the circulation of B. pertussis and do not exert any herd immunity effect.” https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31333640/

     --Your claims regarding polio nonsensically ignore the fact that the last wild case of polio in the U.S. was in 1979 and that the only polio vaccine used in the U.S. for the last 24 years only provides, at best, personal protection and does not prevent transmission of the polio virus. As CDC explains: “IPV [inactivated polio vaccine] … does not stop transmission of the virus.” https://cdc.gov/poliovirus-containment/diseaseandvirus/index.html…

     --You claimed that “we [Pfizer] don’t make the pediatric vaccines, Pfizer is not in that market” to deflect the claim that, as a board member of Pfizer, you have a serious conflict of interest in attacking RFK Jr. regarding pediatric vaccines. But, as you no doubt know, Pfizer does sell pediatric vaccines, including the Prevnar vaccine given to babies at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age, which was one of Pfizer’s top three selling products in 2023. https://pfizer.com/sites/default/files/investors/financial_reports/annual_reports/2023/Your… claim is either a lie or reveals deep ignorance.

     --Your claim regarding measles mortality is based on dubious and unreliable data and ignores the facts that (1) approximately 400 people total died annually in the U.S. in the years before the first measles vaccine in 1963 (amounting to around 1 death for every 500,000 Americans), and (2) mortality from measles declined by over 98% from 1900 to 1960 before the vaccine and was continuing to decline. https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/6200.  In any event, you dutifully ignore the fact that RFK Jr. has made clear he has no intention of taking away vaccines from anyone who wants them.

     --You claim RFK Jr. will cost lives, but I would argue that ignorance regarding vaccine products does and has cost lives. I welcome a public debate in which we can discuss the number of lives ignorance about vaccines has cost versus your speculations about those RFK Jr. will supposedly cause (a man who has actually devoted his life to saving the lives of children).

Your knowledge regarding these products is only matched by your track record as a public “health” official. The plummeting decline in childhood health from the early 1980s (from less than 13% with chronic disease to now well over 50%) continued unabated while you were FDA commissioner. Respectfully, you lack authority or a track record, let alone basic knowledge, to speak on the subjects you address in this interview (let alone to discuss this topic with Senators to dissuade them from confirming RFK Jr.)

If you were being honest, you would reveal that your real concern, as a board member of Pfizer, is that Pfizer's golden gooses – Covid-19 vaccines, Prevnar vaccines, RSV vaccines, etc. – will have to face the reality of the devastating harms they have caused to families across America. Your interview stinks of self-interest. The time for selling out America's children so pharma and its leaders, like you, can line their pockets has come to an end.

The above responds to a recent CNBC segment on which you recently appeared and which you tweeted out in two parts:

Dude, she ghosted me after I asked her if she'd aborted, made up, or miscarried the child we'd discussed names for, for months. She still has my stuff -- and -- she was the critical person in my daughter's abduction. After ghosting me, she lied about me behind my back so maliciously, that I lost several jobs. My daughter needed 2+ years of therapy. Just move on? No, brother, I pressed charges -- and you know what she did? She lied to the police and to family services. Female predators also deserve exposure, so they can't continue to perpetrate without consequence. Advice like yours, here, is what creates an environment that enables perpetration and abuse.

Jake Jackson when I ask them, Are you sure this wasn’t the flu? They say “Yeah, I was out for 4 weeks and thought I was going to die. It wasn’t like any flu I have had before.” Now, I’m not saying I know anything. But that’s been my experience when I asked people about their Vid’.

Pierce Love The mind is more powerful than most people can imagine. What I DO know is that those who KNEW it was a massive hoax, never masked, distanced, or jabbed and we didn't get sick. It's been said many times that, "the diagnosis is the disease." They "flooded the zone" with toxic propaganda, twisting people's perception of reality and creating imaginary fear, and that alone will trick the body into manifesting the exact symptoms they believe they should experience.

Bryan Dean and the rest of you saying it was just the flu nooooooo f… way. I thought so too and although that’s what I believed for a long time, it proved me completely wrong after one day catching something ,n falling deathly over ill. I know my body well and I know that whateve that was that attacked my body was absolutely different then the Flu or any other similar cold virus I had ever gotten.. this was new and it had many weird properties to it unlike any other thing I’ve come to know

Samira I think they tried to strengthen a virus and succeeded, but it wasnt nearly as strong as they had hoped it would be transmission-wise, and didnt warrant all of the panic and restrictions etc. It was a strong genetically modified flu that was deliberately spread and possibly amplified by weaponized 5g but idk 🤷‍♀️ Only a select few truly know or really intelligent investigators who figured out the pieces to the devious plan's puzzle.

Valerie Simpson the weirdest thing was the way it hit me. I was sleeping and around 4 AM I suddenly woke up panting and breathing hard, I sat up on my bed and all of a sudden I could feel inside my body some creepy crawlers internally marching up from my legs to my thighs snd as every move upward they made there was extreme aches and pain left all over my body and muscles lol. All I could was sit like that snd cry from the pain

The psyop of homogenising all respiratory illnesses as Covid 19...a "viru s" not properly isolated by the C DC....nor could it be microscope examined.
While duping many millions, com orbidities became concealed putting the full reasoning of death as this flu like virus, totally falsifying records.
On top of this, the "vacc ine" produced to mitigate such tragic deaths (??) was untested and dangerous to use. Kill ING many.
DNAs tampered with.
The greatest hoax EVER, pride and ego of the brainwashed will very much prevent many from wakening up.

Stew Wilson, have you explored the notion that the double helix model of DNA that Crick and Watson received the Nobel prize for in 1953 is simply that, a model ... no scientific experiments were ever done to prove the existence of DNA. Now that's huge, isn't it, and worth exploring. Dr Tom Cowan has only just started talking about this. I was totally indoctrinated during my Science degree in biochemistry, microbiology (virology and immunology) and genetics and have spent the past 5 years unravelling the untruths and depth of the indoctrination. My 180 degree turn around shows both virology and genetics to be fraudulent and unscientific.

Instead of turning to tinder I turn to church.
Instead of turning to man I turn to god.
Instead of turning to substance abuse I turn to love.
Instead of turning to anxiety sickness I turn to prayer.
Instead of turning to my bed in misery I turn to 75 hard.
Instead of turning to my weaknesses I count on my strengths.
Instead of turning to my problems I face my solutions.
Instead of turning to disappointments I turn to gratitude.
Instead of turning to self harming I turn to self nurturing.
Instead of holding onto my pride and anger I let go with humility and willingness to be guided beyond my own self. 
Instead of empowering the darknesses that have been bestowed onto me I embrace the bright lightness of the Holy Spirit that divinely protects, provides, guides and was gifted to me as a child of God. 
For every compliment you wish to give to me, please give to the Father above for I and every angel he has blessed me with every life saving day I have endured is where the true magnificence and greatness is from and credit is due. 









Do not Get Married If You Have Not Read These Four Powerful Books:

3. "Daring Greatly: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead" by Brené Brown
4. "Attached: The New Science of Adult Attachment and How It Can Help You Find—and Keep—Love" by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller







I once asked a very successful woman to share her secret with me. 
She smiled and said to me.. 
“I started succeeding when I started leaving small fights for small fighters. 
I stopped fighting those who gossiped about me..
I stopped fighting with my in laws..
I stopped fighting for attention..
I stopped fighting to meet public expectation of me..
I stopped fighting for my rights with stupid people..
I left such fights for those who have nothing else to fight..
And I started fighting for 
my vision, 
my dreams, 
my ideas and 
my destiny. 
The day I gave up on small fights is the day I started becoming successful.”
Some fights are not worth your time.
Choose what you fight for wisely.

Vai Tu, piemēram, pateiktu draugiem par šo “produktu/iespēju”?

Konkrēti, ja šo “laistu pasaulē,” vai Tu šo iegādātos? 

Vai Tu priecātos par bezmaksas piekļuves kōdu?

Ir kādi ieteikumi? Maksājuma/ziedojuma "kastīti" māku uztaisīt augstā līmenī...smuka...bet nu, šāds solis ir ilgi bijis vajadzīgs manai mūzikas un kompozīcijas karjērai...vienkārši neesmu uzdrīkstējies.

Vai gribi redzēt, kāda tā maksājuma kastīte izskatītos? 

Ja varu "izgudrot" kā prezentēties, visticamāk šonedēļ izsludinātu šo piedāvājumu...

Domas?







Lauris Priednieks Lauri, Tu šo uzrakstīji: "Es pasmaidu ,cik Tavs ego ātri, mani ielika savā prāta šablona kastītē!"

Tā ir tīra -- pilnīga -- un pat ļauna -- projekcija. 

Tu definē, ka "mans ego" ātri "Tevi ielika" kaut kādā "kastītē???"

Jaunezotēriķi varmācīgi pārņem autoritāti citiem augstprātīgi pārmest, ko viss viņu "ego" dara un nedara. 

Tu šo paīstam uzrakstīji: "Tas viss nē,nē nē ir Tevī!" PROTAMS ka nē nē nē ir "manī," Tu pieņemi bērnu izvarošanu? Tu pieņemi zādzību, varmācību utt utt -- Tu pieņemtu -- ja Tevi izvarotu -- ha ha ha? 

Tu "pieņemtu," ja Tevi piekautu?

Tas viss ir "Tavs ego," ka Tu negribi, ka izvaro, ka piekauj, ka zog?

Šo rakstīt, teikt: "Tavs ego grib būt pārgudrs." Tev nav itin nekāda ieskate ne manā "prātā" ne manā "ego." Man "ego" negrib neko, ko Tu man pārmet -- Tu esi ieslīdējis Sātanismā. 

Vai tas ir tamdēļ, ka Tu esi tik brīnišķīgi attīstīts -- ka vēl pats izvaro, zodz, un piekauj?

Tu šo patiešām uzrakstīji: "Un tagad padomā Tava taisnība ,par kuru cīnies ir tikai un vienīgi Tava prāta spēlītes!"

Vai Tu nesaproti, ka ar Tava veida kultismu var ņemt un visu Latgali nobumbot, un Tu teiksi nu tam pretoties tā taču ir tikai prāta spēlīte la la la, nogalināja 200T cilvēkus -- viņi to pelnīja vai bija noslēguši dvēseles līgumu mirt ha ha ha???

WHAT?!?! "To cik spēcīgi Tevi ,vada Tavs viltus Es." Vecīt -- ja Tu šādi turpināsi, Tevi izvaros, apzags, sasitīs, un atsās bez jebkā. Vai pats sāksi tā rīkoties. 

"Tev vēl dzīvē ir iespēja iemācīties komunicēt." Pats iemācies empātisko un nevardarbīgo komunikāciju -- ja to neesi izdarījis -- vispāri netuvojies man.

"Tu vari dalīties ar savu redzējumu, kā Tu redzi pasauli,cilvēkus.Bet nevis savā egoismā māci ,kā man jādomā!" Tas ir pilnīgi slimi teikt, ka iestāties par patiesiskumu un nevardarbību ir "egoisms." Ļauns esi kļuvis. 

Jā, es Tev varu palīdzēt izkulties no sātaniskās hipnozes, kurā esi šobrīs ieslodzīts. 

"Tā ir ,kad kuģi vada prāts." Kuģi vispāri uzbūvēja prāts. Necieņa pret mūsu apziņas līmeņiem ir arī viena izteikta Tava problēma -- un ja es nebūtu izcietis tik brutālu varmācību -- saskarsmē ar cilvēkiem, kas runā, kā Tu -- es šitik intensīvi necenstos Tev palīdzēt pamosties. 

Šādi saukļi, Lauri: "Pasaulē vieta ir visam!
Kā dienai un naktij..." ir ļoti ļoti bīstami, un diemžēl nebūtu pārsteigts, ja jau nodarbojies ar daždažādām varmācības un zādzības un izvarošanas formām. 

Tēvreizē is precīzi pateikts: atpestī mūs no ļauna. 

Un tas, ka Tu apgalvo, ka mana "izpratne" par ļaunumu ir kaut kāds "ego fenomēns" ir bez jokiem -- pilnīgi slimi. 

Ja esi bijis varmācīgs, ja esi izvarojis, ja esi bērnus zadzis, ja esi bērniņu fētusus ēdies -- ja esi pretlikumīgi seksojies ar nepilngadīgiem -- tad lai policija Tevi ĀTRI pieķer un apcietina!

IR atšķirība starp labo un ļauno - to apzināties NAV "ego," un tie kas "runā kā Tu" rīkojas ĻAUNI un TRAUMĒJOŠI. 





Hei Sandri, 

Man ir svarīgi, ka vīrietis — ir vīrietis. Ka neatstāj cilvēkus novārtā. Ka iestājās par patiesību, labklājību, un labvēlību. Man arī ir ļoti svarīgi draudzēties ar cilvēkiem, kas saprot, piemēram: ka pīles ne”pievelk” medniekus — ka patiešām ir agresori, upuri, glābēji un vēl “blakus stāvējošie,” kurus dažreiz sauc par “skatītājiem.” 

Ko Tu, kā skatītājs, darīji, lietas labā atbildēt, vai Ligija tīšām veicināja manas meitas laupīšanu 2021. g. 1.-2. aprīļa naktī un rītā? Neko. Es vairākas reizes Ligijai lūdzu mani aizvest uz hoteli, kur bija mana meita un xSieva — man pat bija stipra griba — izlekt no Ligijas automašīnas pie sarkanām gaismām. 

Vai Ligijai samaksāja, lai veicinātu Emītes laupīšanu? Es nezinu — man ir arī vairrākkārtīgi teikts, ka viņai iespējams samaksāja, lai izpostītu manu visai skaisto dzīvi. Ja tā, kurš viņai samaksāja? Vai tad to Inese Kozuliņa koordinē? Man ir burtiski brīdināts, pēc izskaidrošanas ko Ligija izdarīja mūsu attiecību laikā, ka ne es, ne mana mamma, ne mana meita — ka mēs nekur pasaulē neesam drošībā — ja Ligijai čeka samaksāja (tas būtu lai es netiktu Saeimā ievēlēts). 

Ar Ligijas manis ghostēšanu un Siguldas bandas pilnīgas manis nobloķēšanas — var secināt, ka jūs kaut ko slēpjat. 

Dažas iespējas:
1) Ligijai samaksāja 
2) Jūs esat sātanisti, un lietojāt mana un Ligijas nepiedzimušā bērna fētusu sātaniskā rituālā
3) Ligija cieš no pēcaborta sindroma, jo viņas uzvedība 100% to atspoguļo
4) vismaigākais, ir ka Ligija ir viena covert malignant narcissist, kas mani izveda narcisistiski varmācīgām attiecībām cauri — ar izteikti spilgtu “smear campaign” beigās — jo sameloja gan policijai, gan bāriņtiesai — gan sabiedrībai. 

Manuprāt, normāls vīrietis ar tiesībām sevi saukt par vīrieti, nepaliek skatītāja lomā - un nedara itin nekā - itsevišķi ja tas vīrietis ir pozīcijā palīdzēt. 

Ligijai VĒL ir manas mantas. Darba rīki, drēbes, lietas kuras mana mamma uzdāvināja MAN, un tikai atstāju jo Ligija man bija ieskaidrojusi, ka esmu mājās — un lai nesaucu viņas mājas par “Ligijas mājām,” bet ka saku, ka esmu mājās. Nu, tad mantiņas palika pie viņas. 

Sandri, Tu noteikti būtu varējis iesaistīties tik tālu, ka es vismaz būtu varējis aizbraukt savām mantām pakaļ. Ligija ir mani ghost-ējusi, jo kaut ko slēpj — jo zin — ka es viņai prasīšu: vai Tu tīšām veicināji Emītes laupīšanu? UN — vaicāšu: vai bij’ bērniņš? 

Sandri, mēs no 2021. g. feb runājām par bērnu — no 2021. g. aprīļa bija iespēja un pārrunājām bērniņa vārdus — un pēc 2021. g. Jāņiem, ne tikai Ligija izskatījās kā grūtniece, bet mēs atkal vēl ar Rūtiņu pārrunājām bērniņa vārdus. Bet Ligija nosauca savu puncīti par 4-mēnešu puncīti, un mums tikai iespēja bija 2,5 mēneši. 

Paldies, Sandri, vismaz, ka atbildēji, manuprāt ticami, ka Tu nebiji šī bērniņa Tēvs. Andris Strapcāns NAV atbildējis — un iespējams tas ir ko tad Ligija ar Andri slēpj. 

Emītes laupīšana un šī saskarsme ar jums Siguldas ļaudīm, ir bijusi vistraumatizējošākais piedzīvojums manā dzīvē. Protams ne, jo attiecības ar Ligiju beidzās, par to jutu atvieglinājumu — bet jo man neatbildēja par manas meitas laupīšanu, neļāva savākt savas mantas, neatbildēja par bērniņu — un tad vēl SMAGI par mani meloja. 

Ligijas meli par manīm ir bijuši ĻOTI graujoši, jo es kaut kādīgi ielaidu tik ļaunu dvēseli mūsu dzīvē. Mums visiem ir terapijas bijušas vajadzīgas — bet protams, ka neatbildētie jautājumi turpina graut ikdienu. 

Vai esam drošībā?

Ja kādreiz, Sandri, vēlies atklāt ko Tu par šiem pārkāpumiem zini, vai izlīgt ar mani, vari droši sazināties epastā. Mana epasta adrese ir dainis@dainis.net. Pēc “dainu meditācijām” laida tumšas, skaļas, binaurālās frekvences ar bērnu un dzīvnieku bļāvieniem — it kā viņus spīdzinātu. Ja tur notiek sātanisms, tad patiešām Tev iesaku no tās vides bēgt, un man arī dot ziņu. Ja citi bērni ir laupīti vai izmantoti — noteikti ziņo policijai uzreiz! 

Ar to, ka Tavi pousti FBā man dod ziņu par pasākumiem vietās un starp cilvēkiem, kur esam ar manu mazo mīļģimenīti piedzīvojušu izteikti graujošu ļaunumu - tagad atdraugošos no Tevīm. To nedaru ar dusmām — bet pašaizsardzībai. 

Patiešām ceru, ja kādreiz Tu nonāksi līdzīgā situācijā — ka Tev sniegs patiesu roku palīgā — un ka Tevi — kā mani šajā situācijā — neatstās novārtā. 







Sandri, Inese un Austris Kozuliņu pagrieza muguru Ligijas ļaunai uzvedībai pret mani un manu meitu. Ligija ir cilvēks bez kuras manas meitas laupīšana nebūtu varējusi notikt. Viņai vēl ir manas mantas -- viņa nav atbildējusi vai tīšām veicināja manas meitas laupīšanu -- un viņa nav ticami atbildējusi vai abortēja, zaudēja vai iztēloja mūsu bērniņu -- kam jau bijām izrunājuši vārdus. Šo Inese zin -- un nerīkojās tā, ka man sniegtu atbildes, uz kurām manai dvēselei patiešām ir pilnas tiesības. Inesei NAV TIESĪBAS dziedāt par mūsu tautas tikumību -- vienkārši vērojot to, ko Ligija izdarīja man un manai meitai -- un viņa vispāri no sākuma līdz beigām -- bija klāt. Viltīgi silti smaidi -- ĻAUNAS rīcības, ļaunas sirdis ļauna ietekme -- pēc kuras manai meitai vajadzēja 2+ gadus terapiju. Ļoti ceru, ka no šī koncerta izvairīsies ģimenes ar bērniem, un latvieši kuri dzīvo tikumīgu, godīgu, patiesu dzīvi





Sure, just hand in your weapons and passports here and go through that gate...





Hey Charlie, if you ever wish to be in touch with me, you can email me at dainis@dainis.net. I do sometimes miss emails, because I get hundreds of messges per day. 

For me, it is very important for brothers to help brothers out -- to get involved -- to not only express emotional sentiments -- but to take loving protective caring action. 

You calling the "Sigulda crew" wicked -- is an accurate description -- and the amount of harm they caused to my daughter, to me, and to my family -- is too much for me to be reminded repeatedy here on FB. 

I will lovingly unfriend and block you and your wife -- your wife never accepted my friendship request anyway. 

The level and intensity and severity of their lies about me -- is too much for me to be reminded of — and the deceptive presentation of their locations as places of peace, harmony, and love — when what I experienced was: child abduction, violence, fake friendship followed by abandonment, theft/robbery, and a literal smear campaign about me that I had to report to the polic — it’s just too much for me. 

“Miera telpa?????” Are they KIDDING? 

I will continue to pray for you and especially for the safety of your daughter. Do not let her out of your sight, if you are interacting with those Sigulda people — I mean that as your brother and authentic friend — I am not kidding. 

If you ever need me, send an email, and most likely, I will be here for you in the way I would have liked you to be here for me — I can’t help it. I have now helped in a few cases where children have been abducted/withheld/endangered — and all of those situations have been improved. 

I only help about 2 cases per month — and for now, I always help without charge. 



It's not wisdom, it's a booby trap. Just another bait and switch.


Jan Johnson that's not how things work. if you've been convinced to pour a fuel additive into your gas tank, several times a year -- and then you find out that exactly that additive is the reason your cars are breaking down sooner than they otherwise would, you stop using that fuel additive.





Jeff J Hunter "You're not part of the resistance when you have the same political view and cnn, google, new york times, apple, amazon, microsoft, pfizer, cbs, walt disney, black rock, and NPR lol"

Rock on!!!

What’s sweet, deadly and slowly ruining the health of millions of people’s lives all over the world?

Refined sugar is the culprit and big business is driving the agenda.

If you don’t control your sugar levels, they will eventually control you and send you down a nasty path of who knows what.

Take responsibility for what you and your family eat on a daily basis. 

It will be one of the greatest habits of discipline that you can form.

Patiesiba atklājās lai tūdaļ tiktu noslēpta. Daļa no mirušajiem vakcinētajiem pāris dienu laikā atdzīvojās, atbrīvojās no vakcīnas un nomira jau kā nevakcinēti, jūtami uzlabojot vakcīnas drošības rādītājus Latvijā.

Joprojām internetā cilvēkiem iesaka vakcinēties un nebrīdina, ka vakcinācija veicina mirstību. 
Jāskaidro vēlreiz.
Vakcinācija augustā par trešdaļu palielināja, nevis samazināja vakcinēto mirstību no covid.
Tā nav viltus ziņa, par to liecina spkc grafiks, kurā attēlota nevakcinēto un vakcinēto mirstību augustā. [1]
Šāds grafiks tiek publiskots pirmo reizi, acīm redzot deputātu uzdotie jautājumi beidzot liek uzrādīt faktus.
Pirmajā stabiņā ir redzama nevakcinēto mirstība augustā, kas ir 1,9 uz 100 tūkstošiem nevakcinētu iedzīvotāju.
Otrajā stabiņā ir redzama daļēji vakcinētu cilvēku mirstība, kas ļauj salīdzināt mirstību vakcinēto un nevakcinēto cilvēku starpā. Ja vakcīna būtu droša, tad cilvēkiem, kas būtu saņēmuši vakcīnu, būtu jāmirst retāk, kā nevakcinētiem cilvēkiem. Daļēji vakcinēto cilvēku mirstība ir par trešdaļu lielāka, kā mirstība starp nevakcinētiem cilvēkiem. Tā ir 3 uz 100 tūkstošiem vakcīnu saņēmušo.  Stabiņā atspoguļotie fakti liecina, ka viena trešdaļa no tiem, kas vakcinējās un nomira no covid, būtu palikuši dzīvi, ja nebūtu vakcinējušies.
Šī iemesla dēļ, līdz tālākai faktu noskaidrošanai, vakcināciju ieteikt, nebrīdinot, ka tā par trešdaļu veicina vakcīnas saņēmēju mirstību, nav ētiski.
Trešajā stabiņā ir mirstība pilnīgi vakcinētiem cilvēkiem. Tā ir 0,4 uz 100 tūkstošiem pilnīgi vakcinētu cilvēku, kas ir mazāka kā nevakcinētiem un nepilnīgi vakcinētiem cilvēkiem. 
Ja kāds sola, ka vakcinācija mazinās mirstību no covid labāk kā nevakcinēšanās un kā pierādījumu norāda tikai pilnībā vakcinēto cilvēku mirstību, tad viņš izplata viltus ziņas. 
Mirstība starp pilnīgi vakcinētajiem neatspoguļo cilvēku mirstību pēc vakcīnas saņemšanas. Lai uzzinātu, kā vakcinācija ietekmē mirstību, pilnīgi vakcinēto mirstībai ir jāpieskaita arī daļēji vakcinēto mirstība, kas augustā bija augstāka kā nevakcinēto mirstība.
Ir jāsaprot, ka cilvēki, nemirst divreiz. Tie, kuriem vakcīna rada veselības traucējumus, vairums, acīm redzot, nomirst vēl nepilnīgi vakcinēti, tāpēc pilnīgi vakcinētie mirst mazāk uz to cilvēku rēķina, kas ir nomiruši nepilnīgi vakcinēti. Cilvēku mākslīgs dalījums nepilnīgi un pilnīgi vakcinētajos ir kļūdains, jo rada maldīgu priekšstatu par vakcīnu saņēmušo cilvēku mirstību. 
Apļveida diagrammā ir pieļauta augstāk minētā kļūda. Tur daļēji vakcinēto mirstība tiek pieskaitīta nevakcinēto mirstībai un salīdzināta ar pilnīgi vakcinēto mirstību. It kā tad, ja cilvēks nomirst līdz 14 dienām pēc vakcinācijas, viņš nebūtu saņēmis poti, kuru patiesībā ir saņēmis. Vakcinēto un pilnīgi vakcinēto mirstība ir jāskaita kopā, jo abas šīs grupas ir saņēmušas vakcīnu un tad jāsalīdzina ar nevakcinēto mirstību, kas ir kontrolgrupa, ja mēs gribam uzzināt kā vakcinācija iespaido mirstību un, vai vakcīna ir iesakāma. 
Augustā mirstība no covid starp nevakcinētajiem bija mazāka kā mirstība starp vakcinētajiem un nav publiskoti fakti par vakcinēto un nevakcinēto mirstību citos mēnešos. Turklāt, joprojām nav atklāta mirstība  no visiem veselības traucējumiem starp vakcīnu saņēmušajiem un nevakcinētajiem.
Tāpēc šobrīd ieteikt vakcināciju nav ētiski. Par vakcināciju var tikai informēt, brīdinot, ka ietekme uz kopējo mirstību nav zināma un augustā vakcinācija veicināja vakcīnu saņēmušo mirstību no covid.

Virālas infekcijas nav iespējamas kā mums visbiežāk tika skaidrots. Tāpat kā ugunsdzēsēji neizraisa uguni, mušas neizraisa atkritumus, un putekļu sūcēji neizmētā putekļus, mikrobioloģiskā pasaule ir mums draudzīga nevis apdraudoša. Ja Tev bija tas, ko Tev ieskaidroja saprast kā "vīrusa infekciju," tad darāmais ir skaidrs: veicināt ķermeņa attīrīšanās un pašdziedināšanas procesus. 

Vielmaiņu veicināt, praktizēt limfātisko pašmasāžu, dzert labvēlīgus šķidrumus, sazemoties (elektromagnētiski ne tikai "ezoteriski"), elpot īstu svaigu gaisu (kad debesis ir dzidri skaidras), utt. 

Lai veicas!




Anneke Beunen you are projective. would you call that toxic femininity? 

maybe femsplain to me why men live shorter, work more dangerous jobs, have higher rates of suicidality, experience the same levels of IPV but MTP is still ignored, and are performing worse in educational institutions? 

then reveal to me which gender can demand of the other: do as i say or i will take your children, money, home, and social status from you? 

some "patriarchy." 

honestly, the heartlessness of modern gender discussions is shocking. did you know that you can care for humans regardless of gender and that most people don't walk around with gender blinders on?

Actually, it is science. I came from a background in science and nutrition. I realized that there was a variable (or two) that I hadn't accounted for, sunlight being one of them. Parts of our mitochondrion can run off sunlight, similar to plants. The mitochondrion was actually an invasive organism long ago in our system that became a symbiotic relationship forming the ADP->ATP cycle, but it can also use sunlight. (science has not told us the truth on this) Like Dr. Jubb, I have run for extended periods without any food, only tea and a bit of honey, gathering sunlight as energy, plus meditation. In the winter, I could not subsist only on sunlight because of where I live. I only needed to eat about 1/2 of my palm full of berries, and that was it, plus the sunlight, yoga, and meditation. I learned that when cleaned out, my skin became so absorbent that it pulled in water from the air, including nitrogen, and was able to actually form amino acids that, in school, I'd been told were impossible to do so because they required essential amino acids and could come from food only. (not true as I explored fasting) This isn't for everyone and should not be forced. I 'knew' and basically got a message along each part of the journey when I could live on various things... vegetarian, pescatarian, vegan, and eventually just fruits. Then I knew when I could do breathatarian. Do I live entirely without food now? No. I can though if I wish to and my system is completely detoxed/cleaned out. If someone forces this, it goes badly. I will also add that food is sometimes used by some in their spiritual journey to stay anchored and not leave their physical vessels turning into light bodies and wrapping up. This began to happen to me, and I realized that food (even meat) has the purpose of balancing us as we need to. Folks operating in lower frequency ranges are sustained by lower frequency foods better. Higher vibrations with higher vibrating foods, BUT I've also met some vegans and others that were way ungrounded and out of balance (top heavy in their chakras and energy systems) and needed to set vegan or higher vibration foods down for a bit to even things out. Sometimes folks are comfort eating/addiction eating. Sometimes people are eating foods to sustain themselves (which most of us need very little to do so actually). Sometimes those higher in vibration are eating food to stay anchored and not wrap up. To each their own and your mileage can and will vary. There is no rush. Don't force things.

Most days I only eat below 500 calories. I don’t lose weight for real for real. It’s all about sleep for me and if i eat at night. If i eat those calories in the morning then nothing else the rest of day and then get 8 hours sleep, i can lose weight. However, if I eat past noonish and get less than 8 hours (which is every night lol), then I could survive on that 500 or less calories a day for life, never losing a pound. So it is possible. There are times i eat nothing for days or maybe 200 calories. Still no weight loss unless i get a perfect night’s sleep 💤 If there is ever a famine, I will be the last to die 😂😂

Es bez jokiem būtu ar mieru šo projektu savest kārtībā -- par ne visai augstu pus-laika algu. Protams, budžets būvdarbiem utt būtu vajadzīgs, bet no administratīvās puses, paredzu, ka šo vienkāršo projektu varētu divu gadu laikā pilnveidot.

Hey, I won’t chat this to everyone. Even as the winner of a 2024 songwriting cometition in Latvia — I really hoped MM would help me become profitable, but the Discord left me hanging.  I guess I’ve been paying $99 per month for MM & I’ve missed a bunch of payments. 

I really needed help to become profitable but MM was basically just a series of upsells. I’ve sent several offers to teach & can even offer commissions on custom piano builds…but I’d actually need to be heard, cared for, and interacted with in a way that supports my profitabilty. 




vērīgos šobrīd vēl sauc par sazvērestībniekiem.





FBā neesmu ar vistraumatizējošākām detaļām dalījies. Nav man atbildes ne par meitiņas laupīšanu un šo siguldiešu iesaisti. Nav man atbildes no xDraudzenes vai viņai bija spontānaborts, vai iztēloja grūtniecību -- vai gāja uz klīniku un mūsu bērniņu abortēja -- un nav man pat bijusi iespēja manas mantas savākt. 

Kad man tie jaunieši RPP uniformās uzbruka 2021. 16. oktōbrī -- es čatoju ar Andri Strapcānu un centos no viņa uzzināt vai viņš iespējams nebija nepiedzimušā bērniņa Tēvs. To viņš itin nekādīgi nav atbildējis. 

Es ar to dainu meditācijas bandu iepazinos tikai 4 mēnešus dzīvojot Latvijā. 

Sekoja manas meitas laupīšana, daždažādas varmācības formas, tad neziņa par bērniņu -- un šobrīd prātam neaptverami ļauna melu izplatīšana par mani kā Tēvu un par manu meitu. 

Es teiktu apm. 40 cilvēku vienlaikus mani FBā nobloķēja, pēc tam ka viņiem melīgi ieskaidroja, ka es esot kaut kāds dziļi traumēts vīrietis, kas pat savai meitai un xSievai esot darījis pāri. 

Par to, vai esmu varējis atrast atbildes, kamdēļ šāds notikums, varu pateikt, ka esmu dziļi meklējis vainu/cēloni sevī -- bet es taču tikai gatavoju, montēju, trimerēju, šoferēju, dziedāju, spēlēju utt -- un ok -- pēc mēnešiem mudināšanas, iemīlējos ar ļaunsirdīgu sievieti -- bet tam nebija jābeidzas ar to, ka viņa burtiski visu manu dzīvi Latvijā izdemolē. Attiecības var arī abpusēji labvēlīgi noslēgt un nav puslatvija par bijušo boifrendu (mani) jāapmēlo -- un vēl policijai un bāriņtiesai arī sameloja. 

Šī dziesma ir veltīta viņai: https://youtu.be/UeQn7t0s2wA





Kamdēļ "tā" notika? Jo esmu 3. trimdas paaudzes bērns -- tolaik tiko atvācies uz Latviju ar meitiņu -- domādams, ka atrastu draugus, iespējas, un jauku sabiedrību. 

Ar šādām sajūtām atvācāmies uz Latviju: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw6xfVZ2LO0




Ja Jums būtu zināms, vai Zaļā villā, Elpārēs, vai "Dievkalnos" nodarbojas ar sabiedrībai (un itsevišķi bērniem) bīstamiem rituāliem vai praksēm -- lūdzu dodiet man un policijai ziņu. 



...un nav...nav izlīguma nav skaidrības -- nav jautājumi uz kuriem es pat teiktu man kā iespējamam Tēvam ir 100% dvēseles tiesības uzzināt skaidri un ticami: jā/nē...un neviens no Siguldas bandas, ne Andris/Eva Strapcāni, ne Inese/Austris Kozuliņi, ne Uldis/Inita Reiteri, ne Oskars Oscha ar Andu -- ne xDraudzenes ģimene, viņas māsa, māsas vīrs, mamma, Omīte, utt utt utt -- NEVIENS nepalīdzēja man pat "drīkstēt" savākt SAVAS mantas. 

Vai slēpj mana bērna fētusa izmantošanu rituālā? Nezinu. 

Vai slēpj to, ka tīšām piedalās bērnu laupīšanā un sapelnās ar kaut kādiem nelāga pakalpojumu pasūtījumiem? 

Vai to darīja valdībai? Kaut kādiem Sātanistiem? 

Nezinu - un tur paliek mani darba rīki, manas drēbes, un citas mantas...

Austrijas policija palīdzēja -- Latvijas policija uzvedās kā pirkti vai apmulsuši.


Officer friendly was a symbol of responsible authority. Armed guards protect banks -- so money is more important than our kids? Armed security protects jewelry stores and malls -- so earrings and shoe stores are more important than our kids?
What do you have against showing children and students what responsible potential use of force looks and feels like?
About 1-5% of the human population is predatory (exhibiting traits associated with narcissism, sociopathy, or psychopathy), now how exactly is ignoring that fact going to reduce school shootings? 
Gerald Lax Start over and re-read my 1st comment. School shootings are a mental health crisis in part driven by attempting to medicate behavior stemming from toxic overload, sedentary lifestyles, direct psychological programming, and nutritional deficiencies. Your strategy of making sure more people become sitting ducks is incredibly irresponsible.

Pie vienām sāpēm uzrakstīšu kaut ko par iesākto ''valsts svētku'' tēmu. 
Tikko man bija telefona saruna ar kādu uzņēmēju, kurš Janvārī vairs nebūs šajā valstī, un nemaksās vairāk ne centa - nodokļos. Es jautāju, kā ar māju, kuru bija plānojis celt, viņš pateica, nafig. Tuliņ kadastrs augšā, nodokļi būs tāpat. Celšot tādā vietā, kur nav par vienīgo īpašumu - jāmaksā. 
Nezinu, kā cilvēku skaitu valstī nosaka VID, laikam pēc izņemto pasu skaita. Jo n-tākie, kuri viņiem izskatās pēc nodokļu nemaksātājiem - šeit vispār nedzīvo. Loģiski arī nestrādā, un tāpēc viņiem nav iemaksas VID kontos. Bet tos, kuriem vēl ir - vienkārši nīcinam laukā...
Visi ārzemju latvieši ir ar LV pasēm, kuras laiku pa laikam atbrauc atjaunot, lai šeit izmantotu lētākus ārstu pakalpojumus un saņemtu dažādas fīčas. Gribētu apgalvot, ka šobrīd Latvijā, labākajā gadījumā ir 1 300 000 iedzīvotāju. 
Tādējādi, 450 000 valsts ierēdniecība, kura domā, ka ir 26% no iedzīvotāju skaita, patiesībā ir gandrīz 40% no kopējā iedzīvotāju skaita, un šāds cipars nevar būt ne normāls, ne iespējams. Tāpēc arī tā ''kopējā iedzīvotāju skaita'' milzīgā cipara minēšana, viņiem ir tik izdevīga, jo citādāk Eiropā to nesaprastu.
Šobrīd, neviens no budžEtniekiem NEVAR izdzīvot ar nodokļos ienākošo. Nebrīnaties, ka nav vairs ārstniecības kvotu, vai slēdz ciet skolas. Tāpēc ka NAV naudas. Bet, algas ierēdņiem un valsts projektos iesaistītajiem - palielinās. Palielinās arī to skaits! 
Tomēr, izmaksas par visu tiek veiktas tikai uz aizņēmumu rēķina. Visi zog kā traki, jo saprot, ka šis ir pēdējais moments, jo burtiski pāris gadu jautājums-  lai valstij iestātos KRAHS.
Tātad, ja 2024.gadā - kurā cilvēki (uzņēmējis!!!!!!!!!) turpina aizbraukt, un valstī:
budžetnieku skaits ir ap 450 000, 
pensionāru skaits ir ap 400 000,
bērnu skaits ir ap 350 000
...
Tie, kas nesaņem naudu no valsts budžeta un nodokļiem, šobrīd LV ir tikai... 100 000.
Nu, ok, lai nu būtu pēc SIA Latvija - aprēķiniem, gandrīz 2 miljoni... 
Anyway. Tad būtu 600 000 (kuru NAV)
Tai alikušajai saujiņai būtu jāuztur - 1 200 000 pārējo? 
Un CIK reāli tas ir?
Un cik ilgi šāda ''bezpeļņas organizācija'' LATVIJA var pastāvēt?
Tajā brīdī, kad jūs kaut ko dzirdat par karu, par gatavošanos karam, par naudu karam un sieviešu iesaukšanu - saprotiet tikai vienu. Viņiem ir ''jāaizmēž'' pēdas. 
Protams, lētticīgajiem pareizajā virzienā, gar acīm tiek vicināta sarkanā lupata, lai viņi kā buļli mestos tās virzienā. Akli un neredzot, ka aiz tās malā stāv kāds matadors (latvietis) ar dunci, kuru jums personīgi iedurs mugurā...  
Un kā tas iespējams vēl veiksmīgāk? Jānozogot VISS ko var, tad vienkārši no šejienes jāpazūd, bet pirms tam jāizdara VISS, lai šeit sāktos karš... Jo tad, neviens galis pakaļ nedziedās. Visus, kuriem bija jautājumi izšaus un iznīcinās, un jautājumu vairs nebūs. Varēs pēc tam uzdzīvot kādā palmotā salā uzspļaujot līķiem.
Ticība ''savējiem'' jūs ir novedusi līdz šim. Ticība, ka Latvietis ienākot vietā, kurā redz naudu- spēs to altruistiski veltīt citiem, nevis ielikt savā kabatā. Nu, ok, šis nav tikai latviešu sindroms, protams. Redzam gan Bulgāriju, Ukrainu, Moldovu un tml. ''veiksmes'' stāstus. Nabagu domāšana. Tikai kārtējais, kurš neizturēja naudas pārbaudījumu, kuram acis aizmigloja naudas vara. Nožēlojamie, mazie cilvēciņi. 
Mērnieku laiki nav beigušies. Latvietis NAV mācījies un nav mainījies. Mazā, zaglīgā tautiņa...
Jā, jā, jā... 
Varbūt ŠODIEN tā nevajadzēja. TIK- it kā PRET Latviju. 
Bet es neesmu pret Latviju. Gribētu lai tā mūžam zeļ un plaukst. 
BET tiem, kas to vada, ir cita sapratne par to kā te ir jābūt un kā būs.
Tāpēc es esmu pret Latviešiem. Pret ''siles latviešiem'', pret atkarībniekiem un pašpārliecinātajiem lišķiem. Kā čūskas lien, kā dēles piesūcas...
''Un pret savas mātes dziesmu var tikai savējie.
Tie paši, kam jauna dzīve un jauni nami.
Tikai tie var pa īstam samīdīt savas mātes dziesmu-
Pašu auklētie, pašu auklētie. Pekaināmi kājiņāmi''

Accountability For Health Industry Predators




Establish simple legal structures that define Health Industry Predation and hold perpetrators to account. 

Current examples are: 

* end of life care exploitation
* mandated medical experimentation
* coerced "well visits" where parents are threatened with the loss of their children 
* inappropriate diagnoses that lead to the use of inappropriate medications
* etc.

Instead of fining industries, the new laws would hold individuals to account along the entire production, marketing, and distribution chains practiced by Health Industry Predators. 

Health Industry Predation would be categorized as a type of organized criminal activity. 

When individuals and companies are charged and found guilty of Health Industry Predation, their businesses are shut down and their assets are seized. The foreseeable outcome of such a program would be billions if not trillions of dollars in cash on hand and assets being made available to build a HealthCare system that does not profit from predation.

Opportunity, security, prosperity, fairness. 


You're wrong about this one, Jāni. The science is unbelievably clear, if you bothered to read it. I'll think about how to prove this to you. One option is betting. Like 80k on our 80th bdays oughta give us enough time. Something like that. I'd be up for something like that if we agree on the terms. Could be fun and friendly. 

It's just that the "science," for example, "proving" the pathogenicity of the alleged polio virus is so absurd, that it's hard to believe than anyone bought it. Have you read Landsteiner and Popper? Do you know what methods were used to "prove" the contagiousness and pathogenicity of polio? Have you looked through the methods sections of the “science” you’re promoting? 

If you look at the measles vaccine, the "science" is clear as day: an industry stepped in and offered a product that deceptively claimed to be causal in the reduction in measles mortality. The product did not cause the health benefits claimed. The health benefits were achieved through improvements in sanitation and working conditions. Women's rights groups reduced the numbers of hours worked in factories. Plumbing reduced the amount of raw sewage people we exposed to, etc.

Why don’t you go collect 100k from Stefan Lanka, Jāni? Shallow google searches will claim that he had to pay — but he appealed — and won. Again, shallow research will say that Lanka’s victory does not mean that the measles virus doesn’t exist — but why don’t you go collect an easy 100k? It’s because you can’t. 

Arguing from authority won’t make the fundamental “science” of virology any more convincing. I felt so happy that you’d gone into emergency medicine — because it’s one of the few ethical types of western medicine available. 

But I don’t have allergies anymore — at all — because I migrated away from germ theory. They also did not need to replace my liver, Jāni, because migrated away from germ theory, adapted a terrain theory model for recovering health and went to the Kroiss Cancer Clinic in Vienna, where Dr. Kroiss had just lost his medical license for stating too clearly online how he’d helped cure C. 

I don’t know if my Shaolin medical training is “so much less” than years of slicing, dicing, cutting, burning, and medicating. We went back and forth at the outset of the convid affair — and you convinced Ilmārs Lejiņš that force vaccinating the Latvian military — was a good idea. Jāni: look at the Latvian birth rate. What about reading the actual science about how the mRNA shots impact fertility. 

What would your response be, if you were 30, finally ready to have kids — and you find out that you can’t — and you start looking into the science behind why — and link it back to what the military did to you?

Another part that is mind-blowing is: you’re urging people to subjugate themselves to procedures where a “bait and switch” situation is ridiculously easy to pull off. There were entire Pfizer batches where 50% of the convid shots were saline solution. How can the vaccine recipients — and how can the doctors — even know what they’re injecting? They can’t. It’s a “trust what’s in the vial” situation — which is not something a sane former exile Latvian should be promoting anyone subject themselves to. 

Which “team” is bullying? Which team is perpetrating violence? I stood up for individual medical human rights — where were you? 

I stood up for the simple assertion that adults have the human right to make private medical decisions for themselves and their minor children. 

Do you know what happened? I nearly got killed, Jāni. Young men in RPP uniforms, who clearly knew nothing about police protocol, were sent to beat the cr*p out of me — they tazed me and squeezed every bit of breath out of me — and I was in the afterlife — briefly. 

Are you “so right” about viruses and vaccines that your “team” needs to send thugs to raid, beat up, deplatform, revoke medical licenses from, and kill those who oppose you?

Did you know that docs had a boy die on their operating table — in Latvia — while they were trying to surgically insert a pacemaker? But the boy had not been vaccinated against diphtheria. So the doctors made a huge hubbub about vaccination — temporarily revoked parental custody from the parents (over their remaining children), and traumatized the family. Is is that cool with you? 

Your assertions about “vaccines” are an overgeneralization. Can you not see that when you say “vaccines,” it’s like saying “tea” or “juice” or “liquid?” 

Are all liquids hydrating for humans? No. Regarding vaccines: it depends on what’s in the vial. 

Please, Jāni, try reading some methods sections. At least the methods sections of the science you’re promoting. 

Also, what about 80k on our 80th birthdays? Something along the lines of: unvaccinated kids are much healthier than vaccinated. Also: pathogenic viruses do not exist in nature. You have to put spit into a rotting culture of monkey kidney, yeast, milk, cow’s blood etc. etc. etc. to somehow prove that “viruses cause” cellular decay? It’s the dumbest thing ever. 

At some point, normal common sense sane people need to stand up and refuse to be injected with “who knows what” because arrogant sociopaths in labcoats are putting rotting monkey kidney stew under an electron microscope and identifying bubbles.

https://discourse.nomineesforthepeople.com/c/education/10 

Did you know that if you scramble up all of the letters in the Bible in a blender and then rearrange the words, the phrase "pathogenic viruses do not exist in nature" appears in the Bible 178 times? Amaaaaaazing!
It's like prophecy or something! Wooooow PCR tests are sooo cool!
Remember: be sure to not read any methods sections of any scientific studies! Just beeLIEve!




Listen up, Men! 5 tricks a narcissistic women use to finish you. 
If you’re entangled with a narcissistic woman, know this: she’s mastered the art of manipulation. She’ll go to extreme lengths to impress strangers, putting on a flawless, charming act in public while treating you—the man she claims to love—with contempt behind closed doors. It’s a well-crafted game: she builds a shining public image so that if you ever speak up about her toxic behavior, others won’t believe you. They’ll see her as the perfect, kind, caring woman and question your perspective instead. This two-faced approach is designed to isolate you, making you feel trapped and questioning your own reality.
Narcissistic women use calculated, dangerous tactics to keep you confused, controlled, and emotionally drained. Here are five key strategies they use to manipulate you and protect their own image.
1. Love Bombing to Create Dependency
In the beginning, she’ll overwhelm you with affection, admiration, and attention. This phase is called love bombing, and it’s designed to make you feel like you’re the most important person in her world. She’ll shower you with compliments, spend as much time with you as possible, and make you believe she’s “the one.” This is a trap, meant to hook you emotionally and create a deep sense of dependency. Once you’re fully invested, the love bombing stops, and the real game begins. Robert Greene’s “The Art of Seduction” details how manipulators use charm as a weapon, hooking you only to later reveal their true intentions.
2. Gaslighting to Distort Your Reality
One of the most insidious tactics narcissists use is gaslighting. She’ll twist conversations, deny things she’s said or done, and make you doubt your memory and perception. She may say something hurtful, then deny it happened when you confront her, making you question your sanity. The goal is to destabilize you mentally, so you start doubting your own judgment. In “The 48 Laws of Power,” Robert Greene discusses how controlling someone’s perception is one of the strongest forms of manipulation. By distorting your reality, she weakens your confidence and makes you more controllable.
3. Triangulation to Create Jealousy and Self-Doubt
Narcissistic women will often bring a third party into the mix to make you feel insecure and keep you off balance. This is known as triangulation. She may casually mention how much another man respects or admires her, or she might subtly flirt in front of you, making you feel inadequate. This tactic serves two purposes: it boosts her ego and keeps you feeling insecure. By constantly comparing you to others, she undermines your self-worth and keeps you chasing her approval. Triangulation is a classic tactic to create jealousy, control, and emotional chaos.
4. Playing the Victim to Manipulate Sympathy
When a narcissistic woman gets called out or faces conflict, she’ll often play the victim card, making it seem as though she’s the one suffering. She may cry, act hurt, or claim that you’re mistreating her—all while ignoring her own toxic behavior. This tactic is meant to manipulate sympathy, both from you and from others. By casting herself as the victim, she makes you feel guilty and responsible, keeping you locked in the relationship out of obligation. In “The 48 Laws of Power,” Greene warns of those who manipulate others through sympathy, turning vulnerability into a weapon.
5. Constantly Shifting the Blame to Keep You on the Defensive
A narcissistic woman will rarely, if ever, take responsibility for her actions. Instead, she’ll constantly shift the blame back onto you, making you feel like you’re always at fault. If you bring up her hurtful behavior, she’ll deflect and point out your shortcomings, leaving you feeling guilty and questioning yourself. This tactic keeps you on the defensive, diverting attention away from her flaws and putting the burden on you. By keeping you in a constant state of self-doubt, she maintains control and avoids accountability. This shifting blame tactic is common among manipulators who avoid taking responsibility for their actions.
The Bottom Line
Dealing with a narcissistic woman is like playing a rigged game where every move you make seems to turn against you. She’ll use love bombing to hook you, gaslighting to control your perception, triangulation to keep you insecure, victimhood to manipulate sympathy, and blame-shifting to keep you on the defensive. If you find yourself constantly doubting your reality, questioning your worth, or feeling isolated, it’s a red flag you’re dealing with a narcissist.
To protect yourself, stay alert, recognize these tactics for what they are, and remember that you don’t have to endure emotional manipulation disguised as love. Set firm boundaries, protect your mental health, and be prepared to walk away if these toxic patterns persist. Don’t let her curated public image fool you—behind closed doors, her true colors will eventually show. Stand strong, trust your intuition, and refuse to be another pawn in her game.

"a racist man?" 

that is called toxic projection. 

How has Trump been racist? If you actually look at his behavior over the last 4 decades -- you can splice together snippets and make Trump look like a racist -- but Jessie Jackson, Michael Jackson, Mike Tyson, Nelson Mandela and thousands if not tens of thousands of employees -- regularly say otherwise. 

Making fun of dead soldiers? Again: you're able to slice and dice his statements and turn Trump into the bad orange man. It's pretty awful actually. 

What is wrong with Trump having 5 kids with 3 wives? I had to divorce my 1st wife. I'd love to have more kids. You're attempting to manipulate my emotions about Trump based on his personal life? 

Trump gropes women, really? Biden gropes -- publicly -- I have not seen Trump groping anyone. Also, I was actually invited to a party where grabbing women by the p*ss* was literally told to me as the "way it's done." I did not go to that party - but that was what was literally directly told to me. Hey, Dainis, come to this party, like when you go there, you can grab women by the p*ss*, if you like her...blah blah blah. That is a "type" of party -- and the women go there knowing the protocol. It was for "rich people" and I was invited as a kind of "recruit" or something -- but that was the protocol. It annoys me that Trump is isolated for that recording -- because there is a whole society that acts that way and the women know what they're getting into -- especially when "new people" get the "instruction manual" like I did. 

"Never tells the truth" is also just plain demonization and bullying.

This time, voting blue is literally a vote to cut up children's private parts without parental consent. It's also a vote for incompetent military leadership that endangers global stability.
What else, off the top of my head: 
* less respect for individual medical human rights not only in the USA but globally
* increased restrictions on free speech
* sharp decreases in legitimate democratic proceedings globally due to Harris simply being selected instead of having gone through a primary (the ripple effect on this one is quite a big deal)
* late term abortions which are clearly infanticide
* radical climate policies that make no scientific sense whatsoever
* price control methods and policies that literally destroy countries
* narcissistic abuse…

 I woke up in Riga, Latvia -- with a knot in my stomach -- because I had a dream that Kamala was negotiating with Putin. She said: "excuse me, I'm speaking," and war was on. The dream then shifted to some rogue dictator, same scene: "excuse me, exCUSE me! Excuse me I'm speaking, thank you..." and missiles were fired. NYC, gone. You just can't speak like that to trigger-happy hypersensitive megalomaniac dictators.
We're going to make it through. I'd say it's time for each and every one of us to pray and meditate and think -- about the issues that divide us & about solutions that unite us.
If you're concerned about your kids, grandkids, and students - I'd certainly be interested in hearing your concerns. I don't know if you know, but I almost got elected to Parliament in Latvia...and many concerns are universal.
Did Tulsi Gabbard or RFK Jr. leaving the Democratic party make an impression on you?




You know, Doc, I was a registered Dem for a good while. This time, voting blue is literally a vote to cut up children's private parts without parental consent. It's also a vote for incompetent military leadership that endangers global stability.

What else, off the top of my head: 

* less respect for individual medical human rights not only in the USA but globally
* increased restrictions on free speech
* sharp decreases in legitimate democratic proceedings globally due to Harris simply being selected instead of having gone through a primary (the ripple effect on this one is quite a big deal)
* late term abortions which are clearly infanticide
* radical climate policies that make no scientific sense whatsoever
* price control methods and policies that literally destroy countries

Joy, relief, and optimism? What about policy over emotion? 

I’m not a “Trumpist,” and I’m much more FMALG (Finally Make America Legitimately Great) than any kind of MAGA, but MAHA run by RFK Jr. certainly does appeal to me, with 70+% of US kids so unhealthy, they’re unfit for military service — and in Latvia, it’s 50%. 

I live (at least part time), a 3.5 - 4 hour drive from the Russian border of Latvia. I have considered buying land less than an hour from the Russian border. The reports you may have heard about “experts” supporting Harris are pretty much doctored up statements made by people who feed off of war. 

Did you see Zelinski & Harris vs. Zelinski & Trump? 

In the Baltics, you literally have a populace trembling at the possibility of a Harris presidency. We’re talking property values plummetting (even further) due to the immediate threat of war. Can you even imagine Harris trying to negotiate with Putin? Interrupting him and saying “excuse me, I’m speaking?” Laughing like that and checking her notes and her earpiece glitching while she’s unable to pronounce the names of the geographic regions her decisions are impacting?

Valda Jefimovs for example: "that global warming is a giant hoax." OK I was not even 10 and I got a US Army flyer. It was a comic for kids, to try to convince us to join the armed forces. Do you know what the title was? It was about the US armed forces being so cool that we were going to be able to control the weather. It showed hail falling on our enemies, tornadoes & hurricanes ravaging hostile territories, and actually, had drawn depiction of how the tech is implemented. 

I literally was very tempted to join the armed forces to learn more about weather, because I almost died in a tornado in Michigan as a very young child. I knew, what can be used for evil, can also be used for good. 

The first weather warfare convention was in 1977, when I was 6. So, aren't there any questions that come up for you, now knowing that humans have had the capacity to modify weather -- for decades?

To continue about "global warming," do you honestly think that CO2 is the "driving factor" in global climate? Haven't you heard CO2 described as "if the weather were a symphony orchestra -- CO2 is like the percussionist with the one stick, hitting the snare drum?" You haven't looked into it?

How about this: look up the best science you can find about the average temperature on Earth for the last "as many millions" of years as you can find. OK?

OK?

Now - look at the data. 

What is coming for the next several hundred thousand years?
Is the planet cooler or warmer, right now, that it has been, on average?

And now -- look at the insane carbon tax stuff. Does it make any sense at all to focus on CO2, when what we should be doing is stopping pollution?

The solutions, to "global warming" are almost bang your head against the wall obvious. Mind you, we're not kids anymore -- i was the IT Manager for REEEP(dot)org, so I literally have insider "whistleblower" level info on this matter. 

I care deeply about the planet and how we're going to leave "this place" for future generations -- but if the majority is so obtuse, it's hard to know what to do -- and I am deeply and very deeply and 1000x sorry for "being high aptitude," it has been such a curse, honestly. I will keep it, it's ok -- but the social pressure and ostracization I've experienced in my life -- I guess simply for having a "good brain" has been really awful. Won't trade it -- and have been doing my best to figure out some way to "fit in" as I am. 

BUT -- for the most part "Global Warming" is a giant hoax. Sorry, it is. The CO2 taxes and laws are ridiculous -- and human impact on climate is actually something that is NOT challenging to regulate. 

We could be creating fertile farm land in deserts with the tech we have - and instead - multiple regions have experienced devastating flash floods. 

...and I pressed pause at 0:54 seconds. I remember the song makes fun of "bleach," and that is also so incredibly irresponsible. I went to the Kroiss Cancer Clinic where they used oxygen therapies -- ok? You do not pour bleach into your blood or drink it -- if you spent any time looking into what Trump was alluding to -- you'd find valid, helpful therapies that have helped a lot of people. IV drip therapies are very very effective in many situations -- as are UV light blood therapies -- and there are machines and experts and practitioners and thousands of pages of science that you could dive into -- but no -- this "holier than thou" is mocking the "door" without finding out what's behind it. 

Clearly not everything Trump has said has been appropriate, or even correct -- but -- this song diverts people from investigating sound science that can save lives and our planet. 

That's what's utterly frustrating -- and it's next to impossible to "get" the in-your-face obvious policies that we would have to enact to "calm the storms" are even going to be discussed -- because patented tech that's existed for decades (sometimes longer) is considered a "conspiracy theory."

It's like the D+/C- students simply have the run of the campus -- and these singers are their heroes. But the lack of ability to question the consensus is just causing soooo much damage! 

And most likely, you'll feel emotionally hurt, by something in this comment. I said something in a way that offends you. OK, well then you won't investigate any of the topics I've raised, and you'll most likely just continue to think of me as a lunatic conspiracy theorist. 

Another thing "this" has to do with Trump is that he invoked Abraham Lincoln's "Team of Rivals" and brought RFK Jr. onto his team. That means, there is room for strong disagreement, but that there just might be a plan put into action to end the chronic disease epidemic in America's children -- and do you want to know what the statistic is in Latvia for boys medically unfit for military service? RFK Jr. mentions the USA stat -- and ours is not far behind. 

So, this song: mocks someone, in a way that no person capable of self-reflection would really want to experience. Do you want a whole song written about what an idiot you are?



That was so horrible. I mean have you read ANY credible science that supports modern viro-lie-gy?

Have you read Dr. Mark Bailey's "A Farewell To Virology" (Expert Edition)? It's not even 100 pages...sure the "expert edition" part might be intimidating for some, but science is essentially just about fundamental logic, which, by now, you should have applied. 

Have you read any of the methods sections of the "scientific" publications that supposedly prove the existence of pathogenic viruses? Like maybe for measles or polio -- or the Spanish flu? They're not that long, and it's not hard to understand that injecting human fecal matter into the brains of baby mice -- does not prove the pathogenicity, contagiousness, or even the existence of replication-competent microscopic balls of death (that you've only seen drawings or computer renderings of...or ridiculous electron microscope images). 

Does your "fraud meter" not go off? 

A very "watered down" easy-to-read version is a book called "Terrain Therapy." Have you at least read that? Like the easy version? 

How many turbo-cancers from the injections, heart attacks, Bell's palsy, crooked-faces, deaths, sterilizations, and cases of chronic fatigue will it take for you to investigate the facts and the data itself?

Now, the data is all available...

I've had a whole ROW of people I cared about DEEPLY pass away post convid injections -- at what point does knowledge become a social responsibility? 

Honestly, until you've read both "A Farewell To Virology" AND "Terrain Theory," please -- just don't "argue" or try to present some kind of "opinion," or call me hurtful names like “conspiracy theorist” or “lunatic” or “unhinged” — all the while trying to keep all the sane people from breathing. Please, at what point do you start self-reflecting about your twisting of reality and mockery of curiosity?

To our Latvian-American friends and relatives: mūsu dzimstība krita no 20T uz 15T pēc šīm absurdām kvafēras injekcijām. Mums katram ir radi un tuvinieki miruši, deļ kaitīgiem “ierobežojumiem” un šīs ārzemju šļuras — kuru uzspieda ne saņēmējiem, pat ne ārstiem izskaidrojot sastāvdaļas!









Emilio Solla Music
Emilio is a bully stay away from him. 

Vai tiešām bijušai trimdai un tās atvasei būt latviskam ir: kaut kas cēls, sakars ar godu, mieru, cieņu, izpalīdzību, sadarbošanos, spēcīgumu, tikumību, gudrību, bet postpadomju Latvijas latviešiem, būt "latviskam" nozīmē: d*rsā līdēji, "Baltu inde," melot, pīt intrigas, zagt, krāpt, nogalināt, nodot, stulbība un naidu kurināšana?

Uz "diasporu" kādu laiku devās tautieši, kas bija ļoti ļoti vīlušies ar Latvijas valsti. Patrioti, kurus kaut vai uz 18. novembra pasākumiem bija grūti atvilkt. 

Bet tagad, "pasaules latvieši," vai "klaidu latvieši" ir atraduši kopību, tuvību, draudzību -- starp latviešiem. Tātad, "diasporā" dzimuši bērni piedzīvo latviskumu kā: tikšanos svinībās, smaidīgi skolotāji un audzinātāji, garšīgs ēdiens -- kaut kas ārpus ikdienas.

Kādas vēl "latviešu" kategorijas pastāv? Vai mēs varēsim vienoties par “latviskuma” nozīmi, par to kādas ir “latviskas” īpašības?

As we yearn for permanence, do we reach for something grand, something beautiful, something unachievable? Is impossibility actually the substance of life itself? 

We love so deeply, yet the love of our forefathers, seems to be integrated into us — but somehow forgotten. 

Would you, Maestro Webber, like to commission a soaring, collossal, magnificent one-of-a-kind Klavins 450i piano, designed to your personal specifications? 


Mīļā Marija, varu savu piedzīvojumu salīdzināt ar rāpošanu augšā pa kalnu. Arī šajā domā "piedot," man ir uzdevums. 

Mans Tēvs bija mācītājs un Vecās Derības profesors. Tas nozīmē, viņš man iemācīja, ko mūzu Tēvreize nozīmē. Iet runa par simtām lapaspusē -- tulkojumi info info utt. Mums mājās bija vairāk nekā 100 Bībeļu versijas. Angliski, viņš vienmērt teica: forgiveness without atonement is impossible. 

Ir sabiedrisks iemesls tam, jo savādīgi izveidojās tādi kā ratiņi: abuse-forgiveness-abuse-forgiveness -- un tieši ar šāda veida oriģinālā teksta nesaprašanas -- esam nonākuši sabiedrībā, kas plēsoņdvēselēm pieļauj (un atkārtoti piedod), varmācību. 

Es šobrīd steidzos, un es zinu, ka man Čikāgā "šis viss ir kādā no tām kastēm, kas ir pie manas māsas," bet varu dalīties ar piedošanas musturu, kā tas man tika integrēts no bērnības:

Bija jāapskatās, bet Ēbrēju valodā sauc par "tešuva," bija arī citi jēdzieni, sakarā ar piedošanu (un atdošana ir arī vērtīgs iespējams tulkojums). 

Ebreju domāšanā, piedošana prasa:

1) “Tev” ir jāsaprot/jāapjēdz, ka esi darījis ļaunu, esi darījis pāri (recognition). 
2) Ievanotam priekšā (Tev ir jāiet pie tā, kam Tu esi darījis pāri) atzīt, ko izdarīji. 
3) (Cessation) Tev ir uzreiz jāapstādina Tava kaitīgā uzvedība (piemēram šajā gadījumā, Miss Siguldai būtu jāapstājās par mani aiz manas muguras sabiedrībā melot, būtu jāapstājās ar mantu un patiesības atturēšanu…)
4) Restitition — atlīdzība. Ir jāizkārto izlīgums. Tas ir nopietns un vajadzīgs process, piedošanā. 
5) Mainīta uzvedība: Šajā situācijām, nākotnē neveicināt bērnu laupīšanu, vīriešus vairs neapmelot, neizmantot un netraumatizēt cilvēkus, nepiesavināt mantas, kas viņai nepieder...diemžēl, es te FBā nedalīšos ar varmācīgo uzvedību, kuru piedzīvojām…bet viņai būtu jāmaina sava uzvedība pret vīriešiem un citiem. Tas viņas gadījumā būtu solījums, jo pats nebūšu viņas klātbūtnē nākotnē, pat ja viņa no visas sirds atvainotos. 

Bez šiem elementiem patiesā piedošana ebreju izpratnē nebija iespējama. Bez šiem elementiem, izveidojās spiediens tādā kā “toksiskajā un mākslīgaja” pseido-kristīgā un arī jaunezotēriskā vidē — kurā varmācība vienkārši atkārtojas. 

Sabiedrībā pašā ir pienākumi pret viens otra — un tas ir arī man atstājis dziļā šokā. NEVIENS nepalīdz uzzināt patiesību, vaino mani, mani aprunā — NEVIENS nepalīdz man atgūt savas mantas: eh viņa ir sieviete un var darīt ko viņa grib atlaid palaid aizmirsti pat dāvanas, kuras Tava māte Tev, Daini uzdāvināja, kuras Tu pie viņas atstāji, jo viņa Tevi pārliecināji, ka esi mājās (utt) — NEVIENS pat nav iestājies par to, ka es zinātu vai viņai bija spontānaborts, vai viņa bija uz klīniku — vai lūdzu mani aiz degunu vilka ar viltotu grūtniecību — mēnešiem? Tik ļauna ir viņa?

Cik grūti būtu bijis kādam iestāties par to, ka kaut kādā sestdienā — viņa būtu prom no mājām — un kopējie “vairs ne draugi” būtu klāt — pat policija varētu būt klāt — un es savāktu SAVAS mantas?

Teiksim, Latvijas latviešu sabiedrība — ir tik toksiska — ka pat nepalīdzam viens otram atgūt savas mantas — pēc neveiksmīgām attiecībām? Brāļi draugi vīri māsas — nesaka: soļo, marš! Un šādas lietas nenokārto? Viss paliek kaut kādā toksiskā konfliktā un visi agri mirst? Neparūpējas par viens otru? Tiešām?

Viņai pat ir apm. 12 cm manu matu tušķis. Ja viņa rīkojās apzināti: viņai ir visi mani ķermeņa šķidrumi — visi. Siekalas, asinis, sviedri, sperms…es nekad melnai maģijai neticēju — bet viņai viss ir lai taisītu rituālus — un tā patiešām dažreiz jūtās. Melni, briesmīgi, ļauni rituāli. Un es tik ļoti negribu, lai viņai būtu manas mantas. Viņai taču arī varētu būt Emītes mati — jo Emīte tur arī nakšņoja, pirms viņu nolaupīja. 





The thing is that the concept of "your truth" is a very destructive thought form. If you're standing up for "your truth," while ignoring the truth, then you are causing damage. People do not get to just "make up their truth," and then shove that into the faces of others -- that's how false allegations of abuse come to be. That's how "orders of protection" get issued based on someone's "feelings." 

"Your truth" is an extremely toxic concept.



Iedomājaties, ja mēs Latvijā saprastu, ka "slimība" ir mūsu ķermeņa un imūnsistēmas "valoda," kas ar mums komunicē, un virza veselības virzienā! 

Iedomājaties, ja mūsu sabiedrība atbalstītu ieklausīšanos mūsu imūnsistēmā un ķermenī, lai mēs spētu uztvert vajadzīgos norādījumus, kā izveseļoties un justies stipriem, veseliem un laimīgiem!





Our "options collaboration" and "technique elaboration" method

EXAMPLE
Dear Lord Lloyd Webber,
(OPENING QUOTE + EMOTIONAL APPEAL) You once said: "Music, architecture and pictures have always been my passions." Your life's work stands as a testament to the fusion of these elements, creating theatrical experiences that have moved audiences for generations.
(FUTURE PACING + VIVID IMAGERY) Imagine commissioning a piano that (A embodies the grandeur of your theatrical vision) (B combines architectural magnificence with musical excellence) (C stands as tall as the chandelier in "Phantom of the Opera") – a 4.5-meter-high instrument that could become (A a centerpiece in one of your iconic theaters) (B a new standard in theatrical innovation) (C a permanent installation worthy of your musical legacy). [TECHNIQUE: Association with achievements]




	1	Korelācija pret kausalitāti (cēloņsakarību) Kausālā saistība starp Corynebacterium diphtheriae un difterijas slimību ir visai vāji pierādīta. Veselos cilvēkos var iztestēt diftēriju. Tātad izgudroja jēdzienu “nontoxigenic tox gene-bearing (NTTB) strains.” Vai asimptomātiski “nesēji” varbūt nepierāda ka šīs baktērijas ir pat mums labvēlīgas? Tiešām vajag stingrus, īstus, kārtīgus eksperimentus, nevis tukšas un vāji pierādītas teorijas. 
	2	Kocha postulāti Vai Kleba un Löflera pētījums 1883. gadā atbilst Koha postulātiem? Vai bija zinātnei vajadzīgās kontroles? Mūsdienu pētījumi nav atkārtojuši Kleba un Löflera atklājumus, un pats Pasteur-s esot apšaubījis mikrobu kausalitāti (itsevišķi savas mūžas pēdējos mēnešos).
	3	Pārspīlēta uzmanība mikrobiem Fokusējoties tikai uz Corynebacterium diphtheriae, tiek ignorēti vides faktori, piemēram, uzturs, vides piesārņojums un stress, kas ietekmē slimošanu. Šāda veida aklums var radīt nepareizu izpratni par difterijas etioloģiju.
	4	Vakcinācijas paradokss Vai difterijas vakcīnu panākumi sakrīt ar labāku sanitāriju, sabiedrisku higēnu un veselības aprūpi? Ko tas nozīmē par diftērijas slimošanas cēloņiem un vakcīnu pieņemto nepieciešamību? Ja citi faktori uzlaboja sabiedriskos slimības rādītājus, tad vai vakcīnu pārdošana nav tāda kā krāpniecība — ņemot citu faktoru veiksmi un viltīgi to aprakstot kā savu? Ilgtermiņa vakcinācijas veselības ietekme vispāri joprojām tiek pētīta.
	5	Vides teorijas ignorēšana Uz mikrobiem vērsta uzmanība ignorē Antoina Bešampa vides teoriju, kas uzsver, ka vides faktori būtiski ietekmē slimošanas gaitas un veselību, nevis tikai mikrobu klātbūtne.





	1	Correlation vs. Causation The link between Corynebacterium diphtheriae and diphtheria doesn't confirm causation. Asymptomatic carriers complicate its role in disease, necessitating rigorous experimental designs.
	2	Koch's Postulates Revisited Klebs and Loeffler's adherence to Koch's postulates in 1883 is questionable due to inadequate controls and criteria fulfillment. Modern studies have not consistently reproduced their findings, and Koch himself recognized limitations in his criteria. 
	3	Overemphasis on Microbe Focusing solely on Corynebacterium diphtheriae neglects environmental and host factors like nutrition and pollution that influence disease susceptibility. This oversimplification risks misunderstanding diphtheria's etiology.
	4	Vaccine Paradox The success of diphtheria vaccines coincides with better sanitation and healthcare, suggesting they may enhance immune function rather than solely neutralizing bacteria. Long-term health effects of vaccination are still under investigation. 
	5	Ignoring Terrain Theory The focus on microbes overlooks Antoine Béchamp's terrain theory, which emphasizes that environmental factors significantly influence disease susceptibility through cellular health rather than just microbial presence.



Correlation vs. Causation: While C. diphtheriae is often found in diphtheria cases, this doesn't necessarily prove causation.

were  Koch's Postulates: fulfilled by Klebs and Loeffler in 1883 — were there adequate controls — also have Koch’s postulates been fulfilled regarding diphtheriae to this day?

Overemphasis on Microbe: Focusing solely on C. diphtheriae ignores other potential contributing factors like nutritional deficiencies or environmental toxins [12].

Vaccine Paradox: The apparent success of vaccines isn’t scientifically valid and doesn't necessarily prove bacterial causation. The vaccine argument is an oversimplification: Reducing diphtheria to a single bacterial cause oversimplifies complex biological processes and ignores much more serious factors like hygiene and industrial toxins. 


Ignoring Terrain Theory: The focus on microbes ignores Antoine Béchamp's terrain theory, which suggests environmental factors play a crucial role in disease manifestation [

Dal Basm DiochaSun
You didn't lose the love of your life, you lost a parasite that was draining your life.
Narcissists are not soulmates; they are predators in disguise, and understanding this is crucial to your healing.
The person you see at the end of the relationship is who they really are.
Their true nature was hidden behind a facade of charm, charisma, and manipulation.
You were lured with false promises, false emotions and a convincing act.
Though underneath it all, they were feeding off your emotional energy, shattering your self-esteem, and eroding your sense of self.
What you experienced wasn't love; it was a toxic cycle of abuse where every day felt like a battle for survival.
Their gaslighting, emotional blackmail, and their constant criticism were not signs of affection; they were tools of control and domination.
Their infidelity, deceit, and lack of empathy were not simple mistakes; they were deliberate actions to exploit your vulnerabilities.
You didn't lose a loved one, you escaped a toxic nightmare.
You broke free from a cycle of abuse, and that takes incredible courage, strength and resilience. Narcissists are incapable of genuine love; they only imitate it to get what they want.
To heal, you must accept the truth: you weren't loved, you were used.
You were a source of supply, a means to an end, and a pawn in your manipulative game.
Although now, you are free to rediscover yourself, embrace true love, and live a life filled with purpose, joy, and authenticity.
You deserve real love, genuine connection and healthy relationships.
You deserve to be seen, heard and understood. You deserve to be valued, respected and appreciated. Never Settling For Anything Less.
You are worthy of love, and it will find you when you least expect it 



Hey, it took A LOT for me to muster up the courage to release this song on YouTube. 

It's about a woman who has flat-out refused to answer, if she miscarried, made up, or aborted the child we'd already discussed names for. 

https://youtu.be/UeQn7t0s2wA

I would very much appreciate honest and favorable comments out on YouTube. 

Sometimes, I write and perform songs along "these lines," and I play them somewhere -- once. 

I think it's time for me to release this song...

Diemžēl, "vīrieši," kas atstāj otru novārtā, nav vīrieši.


Author
Ilze Kon
Dainis W. Michel Visi ir vīrieši tik attīstības stadijas un izaugsme ir un varbūt atšķirīgas!

Piedošana, sapratne un empātija!



		15h 


Dainis W. Michel
Ilze Kon sarakstā ir vīrietis pēc dzimuma, bet ne pēc rakstura. Pieņemt ņepieņemamo, ar atrunu "visi esam savādās attīstības stadijās," manuprāt neveicina sabiedrisko veselību.
Par piedošanu, daudzi ir nonākuši maldinošā miglā dēļ nepilnvērtīgas mūsu Tēvreizes tulkojumiem, un dēļ jaunezotēriķu kaitīgām filozofijām. Musturam: varmācība-piedošana, pārkāpums-piedošana, abjūss-piedošana, utt., mums, itsevišķi latviešiem, ir jāpieliek punkts. To dara ar: atbildību.
Vīrieša raksturā būtu jābūt patiesiskumam, un vīriešiem, lai būtu igtspējīga sabiedrība -- ir uz patiesības pamata -- jāspēj vienoties un viens otru, savējosm, sabiedrību un tautu -- pasargāt.
Blakus piedošanai ir "atdošana," un es atdodu, tiem, kas ir man un manai meitai un ģimenei darījuši pāri -- viņu doto. Tāda līmena traumatizējumus, varmācību, un pārkāpumus -- vienkārši atstāt -- un blakus stāvēt un neko nedarīt (tā var arī dažus citus "vīriešus" sarakstā aprakstīt), ir dziļi un sāpīgi nevīrišķīga uzvedība.
Sapratne mums dod iespēju tālredzīgi saskatīt, kā zināma veida uzvedība iespaidos mūsu tautu -- un diemžēl -- varam nevīrišķīgu, gļēvu, nepatiesu, melīgu un ļaunu uzvedību "saprast," bet tas nenozīmē, ka mums jāpiekrīt.
Par empātiju -- nu esmu tagad ilgus gadus centies aizstāvēt empātiju, gan sakarā ar medicīniskām cilvēktiesībām, gan ar dziļu empātiju pret citiem manu meitiņu audzinot -- gan izteikti empātiski uzvedoties sabiedrībā -- un vēl pat skaidrojot, kas vispāri empātiskā komunikācija ir (var lasīt Stephen Covey -- ļoti labi apraksta empātisko komunikāciju un tās vērtību). Jā -- ar NVC (nonviolent communication) un empātiju -- un empātisko komunikāciju -- var ļoti kritisakas situācijas risināt -- un iespējams izvilkt mūsu tautu no tās bedres, kurā esam nonākuši.
Bet cik ilgi vispirms mīļi komunicēt par empātiju, tad empātiski uzvesties un tikt izmantotam, tad skaļāk un formalizētāk izteikties par empātiju --- nu atkal tikt ignorētam un noraidītam -- vai tad lai nonākam līdz punktam, ka par guvumiem kurus empātija sabiedrībai sniedz -- jābļauj?
Ja ignorē, tagad 3 gadus, blakus stāvējoša vīrieša kritisko situāciju - lai gan viņš Tev ir talkojis, gatavojis, dziedājis, ir bijis pilnīgi ar mieru Tev sniegt roku palīgā - nu tad var secināt, ka šī sabiedrība ir lauzta.
Vismaz mazlietiņ palīdz "diftērijas" gadījumā nonākošo ģimeni -- bet diftērijas baktērijas nav pat pilnībā pierādītas kā kausālas ar simptomiem -- tas nozīmē -- var būt pozitīvs tests bez simptomiem.
Bet diemžēl, Latvijā valda ne tikai apātija pret savējiem -- bet burtiski naidīgi graujoša ļauna uzvedība pret viens otru.
Sarakstā ir vīrieši, kas būtu varējuši iestāties par patiesiskumu -- bet viņi atļāva man tikt melni apmelotam. Gadiem. Kur ir viņu vīrišķība?
Cik vienkārši būt pavaicāt manai meitai: vai bija kā sievieteX stāsta?
Cik vienkārši būtu bijis man palīdzēt kaut vai tikai atgūt manas mantas?
Nē, atļāva man tikt traumatizējoši apmelotam un izraidītam no visai plaša sabiedrības loka. Deva meliem un ļaunumam priekšroku un tas ir tik ļoti nevīrišķīgi, ka vēmiens nāk domājot, ka tieši šie "vīrieši" ir tie, kas pat vīrišķības seminārus Latvijā vada.
Ahā, tātad, ja vīrietim konkrēti būtu jāuzvedās kā vīrietiem (aizstāvēt patiesību, sargāt, vienoties spēkos un risināt situācijas, viens otram palīdzēt), teiksim ja ir praktiska, konkrēta vajadzība, piemēram: kad bērns tiek laupīts ar sievietesX līdzdalību -- tad vai ir OK, ja visus vīrīšķības principus pamet? Neko nedara? Nepalīdz, neiesaistās -- un vēl piedalās graujošā melu kampaņā pret patiešām nevainīgu vīrieti -- kas tāda veida melu kampaņu nekad nebija savā dzīvē pelnījis -- tas ir ok?
Tā ir tā pati enerģija ar kuru izsūtīju vai nodeva vai nošāva -- mūsu vecvecāku paaudzē. Vai tiešām tā ir "vīrišķīga" uzvedība -- otram vīrietim darīt pāri un teikt: pats pelnīja, pats piesauca, viņš izteicās pret valsti utt utt utt?



Ainārs, iespējams, ka es penzijas gados tuvāk intresēšos, bet sobrīd gan ne. Esot intresanti skatīties "emergency flight routes," jo tie vairāk rādot uz plakanās zemes modeli. Nu un?

Viens pozitīvs rezultāts, par manu visai seklo ieskati plakanzemju teorijās, ir ka mums daudz labāk derētu modelis ar 13 mēnešiem, tātad 13x28 ar to vienu "lieko" dienu...

Cilvēki arī rāda uz: "slit test," un domā, ka tas rāda uz modeli, ka dzīvojam virtuālā realitātē. Bet tā ir non-sequitur domkļūda -- kas tomēr pilnībā neapstrīd iespēju, ka dzīvojam virtuālā simulācijā. 

OK: 
1) dzīvojam uz bumbas uz kuras ūdens turās 
2) dzīvojam uz plakanas virsmas ar stikla pusbļodu virs mūsu galvām (bet tad jautājums paliek, kur vispāri tā plakanā sistēma atrodas -- vai tā vienkārši peld kaut kādā jūrā, un kur tā jūra tad atrodas, utt.) 
3) dzīvojam virtuālā realitātē
4) kaut kas cits

Kamdēļ strīdēties? 

Var censties laisties "ledus sienai" pāri -- esot stāsti arī par "explorers," kas izbrauca kaut kādiem vārtiem cauri, un ka UN simbols rāda uz kontinentiem ārpus tās ledus sienas. Nu -- labi -- sakrājam 100 mil un laižamies -- jo bez pamatīga budžeta tur braukāties -- ir ļoti ļoti bīstami. 

Iespējams, ka dzīvojam zem kaut kādas pusbļodas, uz vienas mega planētas. Es to iespēju izliku FBā pirms vairāk nekā 10 gadiem, un manu komentāru tūliņ dzēsa. 

OK -- atkal: un?

Man nav neērti atzīt, ka es nezinu ne tikai kurš variants ir pareizs, es pat nezinu, vai viens no minētiem ir pareizs. 

Atkal: un?

Strīdēsmies? Ja Tu gribi strīdēties, tad atrod citus.

“Please watch this critical interview released yesterday with Naomi Wolf.
For anyone living under a rock: Pfizer and FDA went to court to prevent the results of their Covid clinical trials from being released for 75 years. Attorney Aaron Siri and his team sued, to get the data released immediately, and
won. Tens of thousands of documents were released. Naomi Wolf put together a team of thousands of scientists, medical fraud experts, and data specialists to comb through it. Among the findings of her team:
1. Pfizer and FDA knew early on that the shots did not prevent infection or transmission -- but decided to lie about it.
2. Pfizer and FDA knew early on that many recipients were suffering heart inflammation (myocarditis) and many other related adverse effects, including young people, but decided to push it on younger children as well.
3. Pfizer and FDA knew that over 1200 people died within the first 3 months of the roll-out, over 1/2 of them occurring within 48 hours of receiving a shot.
4. Pfizer and FDA knew that the mRNA/spike protein did not remain in the deltoid area, but biodistributed throughout the body.
5. Pfizer and FDA held a meeting to discuss how to LIE to the American public so that the roll-out could move forward. All of this damning information was also sent directly to the White House.
6. Pfizer and FDA knew that the shots were degrading women's placentas, making miscarriages far more likely.
This interview should not be missed by anyone who cares about their health or the health of their children or grandchildren. Naomi's book, the Pfizer Papers, will also be released this month.”

Charlie, thank you for the invitation. I would gladly come to an event of yours in the future, but only if it’s in a space where families, individuals, and children — are safe.
The person who is responsible for enabling the abduction my daughter — is in this event photo. How do you think that feels?
It’s true that the abduction required that my xWife lie to the Latvian police, but it also required that my xGirlfriend remove me from Riga — which is what she did — even though I repeatedly asked her to take me to the hotel where my daughter and xWife had planned a 5-day vacation.
What followed has been traumatizing for my daughter, my mom, me — and our entire family in the USA, Latvia, Austria, and Australia.
When we accidentally met on the street, recently — sure, we look happy and settled — but that has been because of years of therapy.
I have been reaching out to this Sigulda’s crew — for YEARS now — trying to get my personal belongings back & trying to get specific answers about my daughter’s abduction and my xGirlfriend’s possibly feigned pregnancy.
For a group of people, instead of answering some simple yes/no questions and allowing me to collect my belongings, to start a public smear campaign against me — lying even further not only socially and publicly — but even lying to the police — to the point where both my mother and daughter have written letters to the Latvian police to defend ourselves from their lies — is unfathomably unethical, sinister, and cruel.
I’m sparing you certain specific details, but behind the warmest smiles in “that space,” hides the most traumatizing abuse and violence I have ever experienced in my life.
There is a very faint possibility that the people involved will finally answer the questions I’ve posed them — will cease their sinister and deceitful smear campaign against me — and will seek resolution and atonement — and I am open to that. But for now, thank you for the invitation, but I certainly will not be attending, and for anyone who goes, please please please, keep your children close.
PS: Es NEKAD ne savai meitai, ne savai xSievai nedarīju pāri — un es esmu absolūti ar mieru dalīties pat ar policijas iesniegumiem, lai to pierādītu. Un Zaļās villas sabiedrības piekritējiem: vēršaties droši pie policijas un lai policija jums izdod manas mammas un meitas vēstules policijai, par to kas par mani (un mums) ir apgalvots.
Lai melu inde melotājus indē, nevis apmelotos.
and PPS: honestly, i would gladly come to a musical event of yours where we are sure to be amongst kind people who value integrity and safety. We can gladly play the “weathering the storm — life is about learning to dance in the rain” song — and others. But only, in a safe space.




"Pēc kovid potēm mira 10 cilvēki darbspējīgā vecumā Latvijā vakcinācijas dienā. (!!) Nevienam no viņiem vakcīna nav uzrādīta kā nāves cēlonis vai veicinošs faktors, kas ir kļūdaini, jo vakcināciju neveic kritiski slimiem cilvēkiem un pirms vakcinācijas ārstam ir jāpārbauda cilvēka veselības stāvoklis. 
Šis fakts raksturo ziņošanu par smagām vakcīnas blaknēm Latvijā. 
Katrs tūkstošais darbspējīgā vecumā vakcinētais pret covid nomira 70 dienu laikā pēc vakcinācijas. Kaut kas tāds  Latvijā ārstniecībā iepriekš nav piedzīvots. 
Ir nepieciešama pilnīga atklātība un likuma prasību ievērošana ārstu mūžizglītībā, un cilvēki, kas to kavē, nav piemēroti savam amatam."

Teach While You Sleep
Teach While You Sleep is about how to create online music courses that get results for your students AND are profitable for you Dainis. It goes deep into the architecture of really good online music courses and how to structure them in a way that meets your students where they are and shows them how to get the outcomes they want. It's not specifically about how to sell existing products; it's about how to engineer your products so they can essentially sell themselves.
If you're struggling with sales of your solfeggio course though, I do have some thoughts about the sales page you sent through. Would you mind if I shared them here?

Teach While You Sleep I mean, the books sold reasonably well, when the internet was not a "pay to play" environment.
Mark Zuckerberg's statement “You can be unethical and still be legal that’s the way I live my life,” really turns me off - and I've run a few ad campaigns to sell the eBooks - but doing so makes my stomach turn. I do generate a return -- but somehow I can't bring myself to pay Mark Zuckerberg to extract what his algorithms automatically tell him he can get away with taking.
I've developed many courses as a professional technical writer (which has been a kind of back-up job for me since the 1990s), and I've taught thousands of students live and online -- so have at it with the sales page, but it seems like you and I have the same conundrum.
I can teach songwriting -- and composition -- very very well. Also solfeggio. But basically, no one cares about songwriting skill. The pivotal skill is sales, and that's it.
And it's definitely not correct that a better course will sell better -- I mean that "learn the fretboard in 30 seconds" scam sold millions.
Quality does not drive sales.
I just won a prestigious songwriting competition in Latvia -- does anyone care? No.
If you can help me sell, great...please...have at it.

Just to clarify Dainis, are you looking for me to go through the actual copy to see where it could be improved? Or are you looking for additional/new sales channels and strategies? If it's the latter, what channels and strategies are you currently using (other than running some ads that you just mentioned in your comment) at the moment?

Teach While You Sleep what i'm looking for is for someone who knows how to generate a few million dollars for and with me, for coming up with the modern Guidonian hand.
It's a fantastic music teaching tool, and it seems that pitched correctly, 1mil sales with a profit margin of $10 USD per sale, split between 2 parties - would be a pretty easy thing to set up.
1 million sales
$17 USD per sale -- so some kind of one time offer dropped from $97 with a timer
$7 per acquisition means that we need to give 7mil to the mafia boss Mark Zuckerberg
we then split the remaining $10mil USD.

Teach While You Sleep asking myself what i want: money.
over the last few years, i have had to concentrate on other things, and i left these eBooks "out there," without really doing anything to sell them.
yes, when i run FB ads, i sell a few, but i wind up getting really mad at Mark Zuckerberg for filching not just my money, but like billions of dollars, just because he controls FB.
clearly, he could facilitate financial well being in millions of people -- but he does not do that. it's really disgusting to me.
so "from you," i really honestly don't know. if you have an overload of clients, clearly i can help them put together their courses (i've done that kind of work for decades).
do you have any contacts who could dress up these products a bit and put in 7mil to earn 17mil back?
there are variations like this:

Teach While You Sleep
It sounds like you're looking for someone to 'publish' your offer Dainis. This is a super common thing where a marketer will take an expert (in this case, you) and run all their marketing and the expert will deliver any products and typically run a higher-ticket coaching program on the back end. Profit splits vary, but it's pretty common for the marketer to keep the front end profit (or loss since the marketer is typically the one putting up the cash to run ads to cold traffic) and there'll be a split of the back end coaching program. I know people who make a living publishing other people’s offers.
However, with your offer in its current state, you may find it difficult - maybe impossible - to find an experienced marketer willing to publish you. The reason I say that is because it's not 100% clear what your product does (the outcome a student will get from it) or who the product is for. At the moment, the messaging is about your method, not the students' outcome.
The sales page talks about being for 'professional music teachers', but also for people 'just starting out'. No single person reading the sales page will have a “Oh shit - this is EXACTLY what I need” kind of response because no single person is simultaneously a professional music teacher, but also just starting out.
The outcomes it promises look like they're quite far-ranging as well - from sight-singing to songwriting to improvising on instruments to more general music literacy. That’s not to say that your method can’t help people with all these things, but talking about ALL of them means the messaging gets very diluted.
For example, you also mention that the method is 'amazing' for guitar, but I'm still not 100% sure what outcome a guitarist will get from the core offer. That variation you shared about writing your songs down is clearer, but honestly, that doesn't seem like a problem that millions of people have - which is what you need for the kind of scale you talk about. It seems like a very specific problem that very few people have - which means needing to charge high prices, but this problem doesn't really seem like something that commands a high price. Most singer-songwriters don’t ever need to do this; they would usually just write the lyrics and chords down and can just record the melody demo as a voice memo on their phone. And if you’re talking about guitarists specifically, the thing that will likely go through their minds is "I can just use tablature to write down songs."
Another reason it might be tricky to find someone to publish you is that you also mention a $7 CPA, but if you're talking about running cold Facebook ads, that's unrealistically low; especially if you want to scale. Your CPAs will go up after you've addressed the most eager buyers in the market and with the total value of your funnel at the moment - even with a $97 upsell - the economics of running this at scale just don't work out. If you had a high ticket coaching program on the back end that cost thousands of dollars, then that would be a different story, but I don’t know what that would look like in your case.
You also mention your credentials and awards, but honestly, people don't care about that stuff; they care about what you can do for THEM. I also have degrees, but I almost NEVER mention them in my bass guitar business because it doesn't matter at all to the people watching my videos and going through my courses.
If you wanted this to be appealing to a marketer to publish, then I’d recommend making the messaging less confusing; less about your method and more about the outcome that a single type of student would get from learning what you teach. Try to make the core audience for the offer more on the beginner side (since mathematically, there will always be more beginners, and therefore, more potential to scale), make the total addressable market as large as possible, and increase the total value of the funnel so that there IS room to scale when CPAs rise to $50-$100+ if you start to seriously scale.
Also, marketers who publish experts will also usually prefer working with people who already have at least some kind of established audience as well - I'm not sure if that's something you already have, but if so, it would be appealing to a publisher.
All in all, this would likely be a hard sell to an experienced marketer, but from what you've written, it sounds like that’s what you want.

Teach While You Sleep i'm so tired of presenting to people what they need and not giving them what they want. this happened with my website curetinnitus.org, but that site alos presented solutions that the "industry" did not accept, so my website was crushed into dust.
let's call "making music" getting a screw into a plank of wood -- and basically -- techniques to date vary from twisting the screw with your fingers, to using the flat portion of an outdated knife, to get that screw in. My Hand of Music, is the modern version of the Guidonian hand -- it's like a modern screwdriver that actually fits all of the old screws (ancient music), and all of the new screws (jazz, blues, a-tonal, experimental).
but somehow, my message isn't "specific" enough.
regarding writing songs down -- you're right -- people choose to stay musically half literate (only able to read but not write music), or they are completely illiterate -- and make music with tools -- and make money -- and there is very little "desire" to be literate -- really at all.
it might have to do with the unbelievable degradation in quality of popular music, but it leaves me not really knowing what to do.
I'll re-read your analysis a few times over the course of the next few days.
It's really "hard" to have solved a 1,000 year-old music teaching and learning "riddle," and to have done something truly revolutionary and simple -- and to face such challenges in just reasonably monetizing and spreading the innovation.
I did this with software user interfaces as well -- and where I was doing computer training - because I could "teach better and faster," I had people mad at me -- to the point of wanting to fire me.
What's also surprising, is that unethical moron who made the "learn the guitar fretboard in 30 minutes" eProduct -- made millions -- and I actually have something super useful.
Now -- if I were to explain it to you -- then what would you even need the book for? It's simple.
That, apparently, is the problem. It's a simple, revolutionary solution, to an age-old problem in teaching and learning music.
I feel like hiding under a rock - but I will come back and reread your comment a few times over the course of the next few days.

Sarmīte Poikāne, nu vai "desa" nav tikai forma? Sieru, piemēram, var uztaisīt no kēšiu riekstiem, tik garšīgu, ka ēdāji zviedz un kunkst...

Vai jēdziens "desa" izsaka, kādas ir sastāvdaļas? Ā, "desā" ir "gaļa," nu ok - ko tas vispāri nozīmē: beigtas govs līķis ar sāli. Vai "gaļēdāji" saka: beigta zivs, govslīķis, samalti cūkas dibens muskuļi?

Tikai jo pašreizējā sabiedrībā, cilvēki manipulē ar ēdienu nosaukumiem, lai apslēptu, to ko ēd, un pārsvarā, "desās," ir paslēpti beigti dzīvnieki, nenozīmē, ka tie kas augu valsts uzturu ēd, nedrīkst "desās" salikt ko viņi paši vēlās. 

Ir desu formā ļoti veselīgi augu valsts ēdieni - un ir arī ļoti neveselīgi pārproducēti, plastmasai līdzīgi ēdieni. 

Esmu ēdis augu valsts uzturu apmēram 15 gadus. Dēļ sabiedriskās kritikas, atturos no jēdziena "vegāns." Veselības un citi guvumi ir bijuši ļoti, ļoti skaisti -- itsevišķi saskarsme ar savvaļas dzīvniekiem. 

Un taisu absurdi garšīgu vegānu jāņu sieru. 

Un to saucu par "sieru," jo es to drīkstu. 

Kamdēļ gaļēdāji domā, ka viņi drīkst atņemt tiem, kas ēd augu valsts uzturu, ēdienu formas nosaukumus?

Saliek plācenīti -- taisa burgeru. Nāk gaļēdāji un saka, kamdēļ Tu to sauc par "burgeru," burgeros taču ir jābūt beigtiem dzīvniekiem. 

OK - kamdēļ? 

Mans uztaisītais augu valsts burgeris ir ļoti garšīgs, un es pārsvarā taisu plācenīti ar zirņu un sēņu un sīpolu (plus ha ha slepeno recepti neatklāšu), un man sanāk ļoti skaisti, ļoti garšīgi, visai veselīgi burgeri. Kamdēļ Tev jānāk un jāuzjautrinājās, ka tam, kas izskatās vizuāli pēc ļoti garšīga burgera, nav samalti beigti dzīvnieki vidiņā?

Es pat domāju, ka vegāniem ir vairāk kopēja ar daudziem medniekiem, nekā ar caurmēra veikala hotdog-ēdājiem.

like i can "erase" clouds, and i will literally put 10k on it -- like: i pick the weather conditions and day, when the conditions are right, you pick the cloud, i erase it. 

then you give me 10k. 

i have won every single variation of that bet, because this is a skill i have.

Bez jokiem viena vietējā burtiski izdemolēja manas mazās mīļģimenītes (Meitiņa, Papiņš(es), Omīte) dzīvi. Es vēl neesmu atkopies. Viņa sabiedrībā ir manu slavu tik dramatiski maitājusi, ka zaudēju vairākus darbus. Mana mamma un meita -- abas ir rakstījušas vēstules policijai lai atspēkotu šīs sievietes melus -- bet ap viņu ir vesels bars ar "eneibleriem," kas pat nepalīdz man no viņas atgūt savas mantas. 

Viņa ir kritiskais cilvēks, ka pataisīja manas meitas laupīšanu 2021. g. 1-2. aprīlī, iespējamu -- un līdz šai dienai, viņa nav silti un ticami atbildējusi kas notikās ar grūtniecību, kuru viņa mēnešiem man pārliecināja bija mūsu...no aprīļa līdz jūlija apsvērām bērniņa vārdu...

Kad viņai vaicāju: kas notikās ar bērniņu, kas notikās ar grūtniecību? Viņa pārtrauca visu komunikāciju ar mani -- un sāka aktīvi manu slavu maitāt -- par mani melot -- utt. 

Kad man uzbruka tie "varbūt policisti" 2021. g. 16. oktōbrī -- es centos šo jautājumu noskaidrot -- čatojot ar vīrieti, kurš manuprāt varbūt bija šī bērniņa Tēvs. Nav skaidrs vai uzbrukums netika tieši no šiem siguldiešiem koordinēts -- jo viņi mani gandrīz nogalināja -- aizveda uz iecirkni -- un pazuda. 

No smagākiem komponentiem piedzīvojot šīs ārkārtīgi toksiskajās attiecības, ir "Latvijas latviešu" vienaldzība pret viens otru. Cilvēks nonāk grūtā situācijā -- kaimiņi draugi utt -- distancējās. Ja vīrietis sniedzas pēc palīdzības, viņš vairs nav vīrietis. 

Pateicībā mazlietiņ uzlaboju tulkojumu:

Life with me is intriguing
Life with me is creatively inspiring
Life with me brings joy and happiness
Life with me is beautiful

Being with me is intriguing
Being with me is creative and inspiring
Being with me brings joy and happiness
Being with me is beautiful.

divi varianti...

Rindiņa "Life is a creative challenge with me" angļu valodā nozīmē vairāk, ka dzīve kļūst par izaicinājumu, kurā jābūt kreatīvam -- ar Tevi. Tākā tāds kā smagums...

...labi, joprojām neesmu ticis tam pāri, ka viena sieviete, kas vispāri man iestāstīja debesis un mīlestību un bērniņu (plus adoptētos vēl klāt) un mājas utt utt, sanāk cilvēks bez kuras, mana meita nebūtu tikusi laupīta -- un līdz šai dienai, viņa nav savas rīcības tajā notikumā izskaidrojusi. Arī nav ticami (itin nemaz) atbildējusi par bērniņu. Arī nav atdevus man manas mantas -- un cilvēki viņu aizstāv? It kā es būtu kaut kāds nelietis? 

Neviens neiesaistījās tā, lai situācija tiktu labvēlīgi nokārtota, un tas ir dziļi satricinājis manu sapratni par latviešu tautas spēju izdzīvot. Ja mēs neesam tauta, kas spēj viens otram palīdzēt, tad kāda mums nākotne?

The sculpture ("Teleport") was created in 2013 by sculptor Gļebs Panteļejevs and architect Andris Veidemanis. The object has two sides, symbolically revealing different eras. The front side, made of polished aluminium castings, symbolises the 21st century, while the back side is meant to be 17th century, made of rusted cast iron.
The object, which is more than two metres high, depicts Duke Jacob coming from the past into the 21st century. The site was chosen for its symbolic significance, as it is here that Liepāja Street marks the end of the Old Town and the beginning of the new part of Kuldīga. The object has two sides, each representing a different time period. The rusted cast-iron casting facing the Old Town symbolises the time of the Duchy, while the one facing the Town Square is a futuristic aluminium casting, from which Jacob emerges in the 21st century.
The greatest Duke of the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia reigned from 1642 to 1682. Under the Grand Duke Jacob of the Kettler family, Courland reached the highest stage of its development and power. Under his rule, shipbuilding developed rapidly, the first manufactories appeared and agricultural production improved. The Duke managed to create a large fleet, whose ships carried to Western Europe cereals, meat, butter, wool, timber and everything else produced by his manufactories and the manors of Zemgale and Kurzeme. The fleet was large and powerful, sailing not only to Europe, but also to Tobago and Gambia, establishing colonies there and taking sugar, coffee and spices to Europe.
The principality built ships, produced paper and napkins, wove cloth, brocade and tapestries. Ironworking was developed, nails were hammered, anchors and bells were made, guns were cast and firearms made, vodka was made, vinegar was produced and gunpowder was ground in mills. Sailcloth, cordage and hemp rope were also produced. The Duke also thought about seed breeding, raised pedigree livestock, improved the land with land reclamation... He contributed to economic and cultural prosperity, created manufactures, developed shipbuilding and industry, crafts and trade, founded colonies in Gambia and Tobago.

Hi :-)

I'm a multiple-award winning songwriter, singer, and composer. Yet, I've lived my life kind of like a train. 

A train? 

Yes, with two tracks!

One track: music, composition, performing, singing, teaching, conducting, etc. 

The second track: IT management, coding, Webmaster, Web coordination, teaching Computer Literacy, technical writing...

Kits.ai looks like an amazing match, and I'm an excellent hire: loyal, dedicated, hard working, supportive team member, willing to learn what the company needs to keep moving forward, setting and achieving targets. etc. 

I'd very much enjoy talking with Kits.ai about joining forces -- and bringing me on board the Kits.ai crew!

How do you recommend I proceed?

Best, 
Dainis

Dear Maestro Zimmer,

Your remarkable ability to evoke profound emotions through music has transformed the cinematic landscape. From the haunting themes of The Lion King to the exhilarating scores of Inception and Dunkirk, your work resonates deeply with audiences, creating unforgettable experiences. As you once said, “I want to go and write music that announces to you that you can feel something” — a philosophy that aligns perfectly with our mission at Klavins Pianos.

Imagine the Klavins Model 450i in a dedicated performance space, serving as both a stunning architectural centerpiece and an instrument capable of delivering the rich, immersive sound that your compositions demand. Standing at 4.5 meters tall, the 450i offers an unparalleled acoustic experience, allowing you to explore new sonic dimensions and push the boundaries of your creativity.

Key Features of the Klavins 450i:
	•	Architectural Integration: Its striking design can be seamlessly incorporated into concert halls or studios, enhancing both the aesthetic and acoustic qualities of the space.
	•	Customized Design: We can tailor every aspect of the piano to reflect your artistic vision, ensuring it complements your unique sound.
	•	Unmatched Sound Quality: With strings measuring up to 3.9 meters in length, this piano produces a resonant tone that captures the emotional depth of your most powerful scores.
Your journey in film scoring exemplifies a commitment to innovation and emotional storytelling. As you noted, “If something happened where I couldn't write music anymore, it would kill me.” The Klavins 450i is designed for artists like you—those who live for their craft and seek instruments that inspire new creative possibilities.

In addition to the 450i, we also offer smaller models, such as the Una Corda Graffiti Line Piano. This model features customizable designs inspired by your iconic film scores and incorporates advanced sound manipulation techniques to further enhance your musical expression.

Maestro Zimmer, I believe that the Klavins 450i could serve as an extraordinary tool for your creative endeavors, inspiring new compositions and collaborations. I would love to discuss how we can help you realize this vision for your performance space.

Please feel free to reach out at +371 24 991 446 or dainis@klavins-pianos.com. I look forward to exploring this exciting opportunity with you.

Dear Maestro Zimmer,
Imagine...
...the symphonic landscapes you've created for cinema's most epic stories coming alive in a new dimension – the tactile, visceral experience of sound through touch.
As a fellow visionary who has reshaped the boundaries of his craft, I believe you'll resonate deeply with our mission at Klavins Pianos. Like your groundbreaking scores that transport audiences to other worlds, our instruments aim to redefine the relationship between musician and music.
Your journey from rock band member to Oscar-winning composer is a testament to the power of innovation and pushing beyond conventional limits. As you've said, "I think there are two types of composers – those who compose because they have to, and those who compose because they want to." Your passion-driven approach to composition mirrors our own dedication to crafting pianos that inspire creativity and challenge traditional norms.
We've included a graphic showcasing our Klavins pianos alongside other marvels of human achievement. Just as your scores seamlessly blend electronic elements with orchestral grandeur, our pianos represent the pinnacle of musical instrument craftsmanship combined with cutting-edge technology.
As fellow advocates for emotional depth in art, David Klavins and I resonate with your commitment to creating sonic landscapes that evoke powerful emotions. Your work on films like "Inception," "Interstellar," and "Dunkirk" demonstrates a mastery of evoking complex feelings through sound, much like our pianos aim to deliver a multisensory experience that goes beyond mere hearing.
We present to you, two of our meticulously crafted models, for your consideration:
The Una Corda Graffiti Line Piano:
• Cinematic Integration: Design elements inspired by your most iconic film scores, such as the pulsing rhythms of "Pirates of the Caribbean" or the ethereal textures of "Blade Runner 2049." • Soundtrack Showcase: Transform the piano's exterior into a visual narrative of your most memorable compositions, featuring motifs from key scenes or characters you've brought to life musically. • Technological Fusion: Integrate cutting-edge sound manipulation techniques inspired by your innovative approaches to scoring, creating a unique fusion of acoustic and electronic music-making.
The Klavins 450i Model:
• Architectural Marvel: An integrated architectural build designed to become a permanent, breathtaking centerpiece of your studio or concert hall, perhaps inspired by the grandeur of your "Gladiator" score. • Customized Integration: We can tailor every aspect to reflect your commitment to pushing boundaries in sound design, such as incorporating elements from your famous "Time" theme from "Inception." • Unparalleled Sound: Standing at 4.5 meters tall, this piano delivers an acoustic experience as powerful and moving as the most impactful moments in your scores.
These pianos aren't just instruments; they're a celebration of innovation and emotional depth, embodying the same drive for excellence and boundary-pushing that has propelled you to the forefront of film composition. We can equip them with cutting-edge sound technology that enhances your ability to experiment with new sonic landscapes, or even commission piano pieces inspired by your most iconic themes.
Maestro Zimmer, your life has been about harmonizing technological innovation with artistic expression. These pianos offer a new way to explore that balance — a chance to create instruments as groundbreaking as your scores and as emotionally resonant as the stories you've helped tell through music.
Have any new musical possibilities or collaborations come to mind while reading this letter?
We'd love to explore how a custom Klavins piano, tailored specifically for you, could enhance your creative process and resonate with your vision for pushing the boundaries of cinematic soundscapes. Whether it's a series of visually stunning Graffiti Line Una Cordas for your studio, a customized showpiece piano for a future concert tour, or a monumental 450i for a new scoring facility, these instruments can become a lasting testament to your contributions to the art of film music.
To discuss commissioning one or more instruments that reflect your commitment to innovation and emotional depth in music, please reach out at +371 24 991 446 or dainis@klavins-pianos.com.
In harmony with innovation and the pursuit of sonic excellence,

Jūlija! Ļoti sirsnīgs un liels paldies, ka ar Lindu Liepiņu esat sakarā ar šo "diftērijas" pārmetumu, Madonas bāriņtiesā, iesaistījušās. 

No sistēmu zinātnes puses varu sniegt info un atbalstu, ja vajag. Piemēram: "Diftērijas baktērijas var būt un bieži tiek atrastas -- pilnīgi veselos cilvēkos." Pavaicā ja sanāk nedrošība. To apstiprinās. Neviens nebūs spējīgs pierādīt, ka bez operācijas, vai arī ar nieru aparāta filtru, ka puisītis nebūtu miris. 

Atgriezt puisītim krūtis -- un viņam ielikt elektrokardiostimulatoru??? Vai tiešām puisītis mira uz operācijas galda?

Ja tā, patiešām kriminālleitai ir jātiek uzņemtai -- pret ārstiem. 

Skatoties Latvijas Tautas kanāla raidījumu -- kas nupat bija Tiktokā -- pat LTV darbinieki nespēj būt tik cietsirdīgi, ka vaino "nevakcinēšanu," ar puisīša miršanu. 

Vēlreiz liels un sirsnīgs paldies, ka iesaistaties!

David, yeah, i've also had no accomplishments since HS, no degrees, so accolades, no awards, no books written, and no certificates. Tiffany is right, even though


Tiffany, and I can tell that you do not stand a chance "against" me in a logical & rational debate of any kind. 

Pick a topic. Want to stay on Haitian Vodou, animal sacrifice, and consumption? Did you know that other cultures treat animals differently than yours? How culturally blind can you be? 

Do you really think arguing from authority will "work" for you to prove your case? How well do you know the standard logical fallacies to avoid, when reasoning? Are you even able to construct logical arguments that lead to sound conclusions yourself -- or do you rely on "fact checkers?" Do you have any training, education, or competence in logical thought or systems science? 

This reminds me of a recent global fiasco, in which the C and D students essentially "took over" the global campus, and ostracized, ignored, imprisoned, de-platformed, (and worse), the A and A+ students. 

Since your inability to comment rationally has led you to move the discourse in a vulgar direction -- does injecting human fecal matter into the brains of mice prove the existence of the pathogenicity and contagiousness of the polio virus? Do you read actual science, along with the methods sections, or do you just read the summaries and "trust" paid "fact checkers?"

I have suffered greatly due to my intellectual competence, but see, Tiffany, you allow yourself to demean and insult, and make irrational arguments, possibly because we've never been in the same room. 

Esther, will remember, for example, that our HS math team won the Illinois State Math Competition -- in part, due to my participation -- but then they did not take me to Nationals, because I was not officially on the math team. Ms. Frejlik, bless her heart, felt guilty about inviting me to nationals, because I hadn't really joined the team -- but she kept asking me to go to math meets, because of my skill. 

Your arrogance does not make you right, Tiffany. If you want, comment on those posts of mine where you've found "sources" that are woefully unreliable. Go ahead. 

Did you know that because I've seen videos of the flooding in NC on TikTok -- that means that those alleged floods are all just lies? You're right, Tiffany, Chimney Rock is actually there -- there's no flooding -- I just believed fake flooding videos posted by anecdotal lunatics on TikTok!

For me, truth is my guiding light, and I enjoy being shown where I've misunderstood something -- it's clear from your comment that you do not discard false beliefs when shown you're wrong.

never posted:
those are very kind responses. it took two women to really destroy my life. i'd handled all of the chaos, abuse, deception, etc. that my xWife dished out. raised our daughter (i mean check out the "albums" in my FB photos). i had to post a few pictures, because my xWife was collecting unemployment money claiming that our daughter lived with her (when she factually completely left our daughter with me), and that caused...

it caused the Austrian government to file bankruptcy charges against me...and i said i would not pay fictitious debts...so then...it became illegal for me to earn any money from my businesses for 3+ years. 

i got through all of that. i won all of the court cases. literally all of them. the Austrian law is that if a mother says something, it's considered true and legally binding -- and a dad always has to prove whatever is "other than what a mother says." so i've spent 17 years, basically being lied about, raising our daughter, and disproving my xWife's lies. 

But the woman that song "A song called more" is about (TikTok), she swooped in and: 1) enabled my daughter's abduction 2) SA'd me (and i am not kidding) 3) convinced me to stay in a relation with her that i was loved and home and safe etc. 4) very convincingly showed her "4-month tummy" and had us discuss baby names also w her daughter 5) we were only at 2,5 months -- i asked if there was another man 6) there was a relationship rift, and i left her a voicemail message asking if she'd aborted or miscarried our child 7) she completely ghosted me and convinced all of her friends that i'm mentally ill and damaged from childhood etc. 

literally, she still has my tools and clothes and other things left at her place when she'd convinced me that i was home. 

in typical "good man" fashion i'd: done lawn work, garding and trimmer work for her, put up curtains, chauffeured, cooked, fixed, etc. 

really, the only thing i've "wanted" from my xGF is: clarity about her behavior with regard to my daughter's abduction, i really did want to talk the SA through (because she promised we would), but i can let that slide...but i want my stuff back...and i want to know if she aborted or miscarried our child...and i'd want her to stop lying about me all around Latvia thereby totally ruining my reputation and costing me multiple jobs -- and causing some people to be horrifically angry at me -- but it's for things that just aren't true. 

...i did everything for my xWife to be comfortable during pregnancy. From buying the right foods to getting just the right kinds of massage oils and learning how to massage a woman through pregnancy (which points to massage which not, etc.) my xWife did not work for over 3 years from pregnancy though to when our daughter was about 4...so i guess maybe it was 4 years. we're talking a beautifully furnished apartment in the 8th district of Vienna -- beautiful. Very expensive piano -- artwork on the walls -- organic food -- fancy bed -- pillows -- everything. 



"Trauma doesn't make people stronger. It damages their nervous system. It hijacks their digestive track. It keeps the person in a constant loop of hypervigilance. To tell someone they are stronger because of trauma is to deny what it has cost them to survive."
Nate Postlethwait

Traumas nespēcina. Tās bojā nervu sistēmu un sačakarē gremošanu. Dēļ traumatizējumiem, cilvēks nonāk nemitīgā, pārmērīgā un graujošā modrības stāvoklī. Apgalvot, ka kāds ir kļuvis stiprāks traumas dēļ, nozīmē noliegt cenu, kas ir tikusi maksāta, lai vispāri pārdzīvotu.

investigate the causes from physical to emotional to cognitive to spiritual. has he been injected with cross-gender DNA? what kind of hormone disruption is he exposed to? also: it makes perfect sense to want to be a woman these days. you get entitlement, money, power -- control. i mean and as a "trans woman," wow, he'll get attention, praise, status and more. 

makes perfect sense. who would want to be male in his immediate society? everything about maleness is considered toxic and bad. why would he want to be male?

still, a fundamental truth is that he was made to be the way he is. and that, i believe, is our duty as parents to foster, nourish, and love -- unmodified and unadulterated. 

individuals who go down the path of chemical alteration hormone blockers, surgical castration and modification -- in general need A LOT of love - like loads and loads and loads of love - because somehow someone has convinced them that they are not perfect and lovable just exactly as they are. it's a horrible thing to do to impressionable minds -- to convince people that there is something innately incorrect about their bodies. it's cruel, profitable, and deeply deeply evil. 

The best way we can counter that evil, is to love, precisely.

Patriarchy: a forgotten system in which men built, innovated, protected, and maintained safety for families, communities, and nations.

Patriarchy: a forgotten system in which men built, innovated, protected, and maintained safety for families, communities, and nations. I'm tired, Sophia, and the toxic impact of female-entitlement, that punishes good men for the behavior of the 1-4% "bad men," at the hands of the 1-4% "predatory & devouring women," cannot be overstated
This whole feminist golden uterus syndrome bait and switch trick swallowed whole by current western society, should really be rejected and transformed.
How much more male suicidality, shortened life-spans, educational failures, and demonization of fatherhood do we need to endure for people to realize that we certainly do not live in a patriarchy?
Literally everything around you that keeps you comfortable and safe was built by men, for women and the safety and comfort of their families. Dirty sewers and dangerous heights are populated by the bravest of men, only for them to be demeaned and called names and kept from their own children.
Here is a patriarchy test. Which gender can demand: do as I say or I will take your children, home, money and social status from you?
Please answer honestly. Which gender can do that to the other?
Yes, we need to deal with predation -- both male and female predation, but a patriarchy would be benevolent.
Or at least a "patriarchy" would provide advantage to men.
We live in a malignant, anti-family matriarchy.


Yeah, I agree "wtf?!?!" Patriarchy was system in which benevolent men built, innovated, protected, and maintained safety for families, communities, and nations. Now, men are berated for being male, and no one knows what a woman is. Clearly, cooperation is the synergistic goal, not just for intimate relationships, but for society as a whole -- and what's happening now? A specific kind of male-bashing toxic feminism has created a legal situation where women can demand from men: do what I say or I will take your money, children, home, and social status from you faster than you can blink. Actually, women can decide years later than consensual relations -- weren't consensual -- I mean women can and do destroy men's lives -- regularly -- to the point where male suicidality is three times that of women's.


ok, i am going to admit/share something with you...i was severely traumatized starting April 2021. First, my daughter was abducted, then, as a male, I was raped by a woman. Then, she convinced me to stay in relationship with her, because she promised that we would talk about what happened and we would heal all of our traumas, together. She convinced me that she loved me, that her home was my home (even though as a child of refugees, i never really had a "home"), she asked me if i would hold her hand as she passed away (saying that she "felt" she was going to pass away before me), then she either faked a pregnancy -- or was pregnant -- and we named our child -- then, when i asked her what happened with the baby, had she miscarried or aborted our child -- she ghosted me and has not explained if she was pregnant or not -- has not explained why she drove me out of Riga (thereby enabling my daughter's abduction), and she still has my personal belongings. I am deeply traumatized - was able to reestablish contact with my daughter - and there are some details i don't really need to share here. it's just that with all of the trauma, i have come into a state of near poverty. i have flashbacks from the violence i experienced (i was also subjected to severe "maybe police" brutality"), and my xWife was also physically abusive. So xWife -- pathological liar -- i raised our daughter for 10 years as a FB single dad. then this xGF swooped in and perpetrated classic narcissistic abuse along with rape. I had been praying DEEPLY for a good woman and wife to come into our lives. I feel deeply and horrifically betrayed by God. I have no idea why my "guardian angels" did not protect me, in particular from this xGF. The only job i have right now is this commission based outreach position, selling these klavins pianos. i have sent physical letters to Trump and Musk. i am REALLY struggling with ptsd and need to get about 100 of these letters out -- but then i am confronted with being a composer - having award winning songs -- and having had my career basically go nowhere. i am really having a hard time writing these letters, and i wanted to get 10 of them written today -- but i failed. i am getting sleepy and my spine is still in severe flight or flight mode -- even though the rape was April 2021. I've gotten a plethora of professional help, but can't afford any more. I need to sell one of these 450i pianos - this month. I need a commitment to purchase. Now. Please help me -- because just one sale - would pretty much save my life.

Virs zemes nav taisnības, dūrei tik spēks,
Kas varmākiem skādi dar, nosaukts tiek grēks,
Par tiesnešiem. cienīti blēži sēž
Un "godīgi" ādu nost citiem plēš,
Un cienīgtēvs, zaglis, teic sprediķus:
"Tik pacieties, debesīs labāki būs!"

Virs zemes nav laimes, tik zvēru pulks bļauj,
Viens otram iz mutes tie kumosu rauj,
Un priecīgs ikkatris, kad vēders tam pilns,
Kad bērni ir veseli, dzīvoklis silts.
Un glaimojot salkušie rakstnieki sauc:
"Cik praktiska tauta, tai cerību daudz!"

Jā, cerību gan. Bet nosirmos laiks,
Vēl redzams būs strādnieku moku pilns vaigs,
Vēl liekēži slinkos un godīgi krāps,
Vēl ļaudis pēc debesu valstības slāps,
Zem kājām varmākas taisnību mīs,
Par kaujamiem lopiem vēl cilvēkus dzīs,
Un muļķīgas dzejas vēl dzejnieki kals
Un vaimanās paši, kad salks tie un sals.

Labs dzejnieks un pareģis bija mūsu tautas dēls Eduards Veidenbaums. Visu cieņu viņam.

Ainārs, cienu Tevi un to ko tu dari, iedvesmodams daudzus cilvēkus, taču ar trīs veču nespēju tikt galā ar vienu sievišķi jau nu nevajadzētu plātīties. Tas galīgi nav vīru cienīgs pasākums. Turklāt šādu māti saviem bērniem, ja pareizi saprotu, pats izvēlējies. Pistoli pie galvas neviens neturēja. Tagad visiem stāstīt par savu izvēli un tās sekām ir vīrieša necienīgs gājiens

Baiba, mīļā labā skaistā dvēselīte, lūdzu pārdomā šo komentēto. Atstāj uzrakstīto, protams, bet šī ir klasiskā post-padomju upuru vainošana. Dēļ šāda veida domāšanas, no vissīkāmiem pārkāpumiem draudzībās -- līdz izsūtīšanām un apcietināšanu -- līdz pašiem kariem -- šo tehniku lieto lai vainotu upurus un lai agresori (perpetrators, parasites, vampires, psychopaths, sociopaths, narcissists) varētu brīvi darboties un darīt pāri.
Jā, ir ļoti izteikti drosmīgi un vīrišķīgi, ka Ainārs šādi atverās. Ļoti!
Nav neviena vīrieša atbildība "nokontrolēt" vai "tikt galā," vai "savaldīt," jelkādas sievietes uzvedību. Viņa ir brīva un viņa atbild par savām rīcībām. Sabiedrībai vēl jāpieaug, lai sāktu turēt sievietes pie atbildības par varmācību, krāpšanos, zādzību, utt utt utt.
"Pats izvēlējies" arguments ir ļoti vājš, nepatiess, un "garām." Kamdēļ: jo viņa taču tā neuzvedās, kad viņu izvēlējās Ainārs!
Vai es savu xSievu būtu apprecējis, zinādams, ka viņa savas maģistru studijas viltoja 3 gadus pirms laulājāmies? Protams ka nē -- viņa savu ģimeni, manu ģimeni, visus piemānīja -- un tikai pēc 10 gadiem atklājās, ka viņa ir profi un vispāri ļoti augsta līmeņa krāpniece. Es to nezināju -- es tādu neizvēlējos -- un Ainārs arī nē.
Ainārs man stāstīja par savu sapņaino dzīvi kā bio lauksaimieks ar skaistiem bērniem un brīnišķīgu sievu. Tad "kaut kas" ielauzās.
Tas notiek un iespējams, ka Diāna pati cieš. Dziļi.
Bet ko dara draugi? Draugi atbalsta draudzību draugā -- nevis noziegumus draugā. Patiesiskumu un labestību draugā un sabiedrībā -- nevis "draugu pašu vienalga ko tas cilvēks dara."
Mums ir jāpieaug, paīstam, kā sabiedrība, un ir jābeidz upurus vainot par agresoru rīcībām. Mums ir jāizbeidz jaukt seku ar cēloni.
Viņa atbild par savām rīcībām un Ainārs ir ļoti drosmīgs vīrišķīgs vīrietis dēļ tā, ka šādi dalās.

Baiba Zvaigznīte jā, un iedomājies kas notiktos, ja pret to manu xDraudzeni, viņas tuvinieki vienkārši būtu teikuši:
* Tu traka esi palikusi? Izskaidro Tavu iesaisti Daiņa meitas laupīšanā. Izskaidro to viņam tūliņ u patiesi!
* Kas Tev vispāri galvā ierāpoja??? Atbildi Dainim pēdīgi uz jautājumu vai bij bērniņš?
Šī dziesma: https://www.tiktok.com/@dainisw.../video/7405945210817039648
ir par TEVI, un viņš taisās Tavu vārdu ielikt kā veltījumu.
Tu tiešām izturi, ka viņu vilki aiz deguna par bērniņu no 2021. feb līdz augustam -- un tad vienkārši neatbildēji, kas notikās ar jūsu bērnu - kam jau jūs bijāt vārdiņus apsvēruši -- kopš aprīļa?
Kā Tu vispāri spēj naktīs gulēt, zinādama kādaa sāpes Tu Dainī es izraisījusi?
* umm - vēl POLICIJU APMELOT? Vai Tu esi pilnīgi jukusi prātā? Daiņa meita un mamma abas divas aizrakstīja vēstules policijai, lai atspēkotu Tavus trakos melos par Daini, Daiņa uzvedību pret savu meitu, un Daiņa uzvedību pret viņa xSievu. Teiksim tāāā melot, pat Daiņa xSieva pret Tevi visticamāk tiesā izteiksies. Sanāk nelegāli cilvēka slavu tīšām maitāt - un Tu ļoti labi zini, ka Tu melo!
* un taču iedodi Dainim SAVAS mantas atpakaļ! Tev vajag viņa darba rīkus un drēbes -- Tev vajag Daiņa mammas mīļāko gurķu iesālīšanos burciņu? Kas ir ar Tevi? Atļauj Dainim savāks SAVAS mantas.
* un vēl, Dainis man izstāstīja, ka ir viena patiešām graujoša un sāpīga detaļa starp jums, ar kuru viņš nevēlās dalīties -- kuru Tu svēti solīji ar viņu izrunāt -- vispāri, ka jūsu attiecības bija balstītas uz tā solījuma. Kamdēļ Tu to solījumu nepildi? Tev un jums nav man jāsaka par ko iet runa -- bet kur Tev ir godīgums un cieņa pret savu līdzcilvēku?
Tu neredzi, ka Dainis veselas četras grupas ar bērniņiem, ar kuriem viņš dziedāja -- darbs, kuru viņš mīl -- ka viņš tās grupas zaudēja: dēļ TAVIEM MELIEM?
Iedomājies, Baiba, ja mēs aizstāvētu patiesiskumu viens otrā. Godīgumu. Izlīgumus.
Iedomājies, ja mēs nejauktu seku un cēloni -- un spētu pat sievietes turēt pie atbildības -- par to ko viņas dara!
WOW -- kas par sabiedrību mums izveidotos. Atbildīgos turētu pie atbildības -- nevis, ka upurus vainotu par piedzīvoto.
Ātri, vismaz var cilvēku raksturu uztvert, šādi pārdomājot iespējas -- no noziedznieki, krāpnieki, vampīri utt utt -- ir taču tie -- kuri vēlas lai upuri "skatītos sevī."

Ainārs, cienu Tevi un to ko tu dari, iedvesmodams daudzus cilvēkus, taču ar trīs veču nespēju tikt galā ar vienu sievišķi jau nu nevajadzētu plātīties. Tas galīgi nav vīru cienīgs pasākums. Turklāt šādu māti saviem bērniem, ja pareizi saprotu, pats izvēlējies. Pistoli pie galvas neviens neturēja. Tagad visiem stāstīt par savu izvēli un tās sekām ir vīrieša necienīgs gājiens

Baiba, mīļā labā skaistā dvēselīte, lūdzu pārdomā šo komentēto. Atstāj uzrakstīto, protams, bet šī ir klasiskā post-padomju upuru vainošana. Dēļ šāda veida domāšanas, no vissīkāmiem pārkāpumiem draudzībās -- līdz izsūtīšanām un apcietināšanu -- līdz pašiem kariem -- šo tehniku lieto lai vainotu upurus un lai agresori (perpetrators, parasites, vampires, psychopaths, sociopaths, narcissists) varētu brīvi darboties un darītu pāri.
Jā, ir ļoti izteikti drosmīgi un vīrišķīgi, ka Ainārs šādi atverās. Ļoti!
Nav neviena vīrieša atbildība "nokontrolēt" vai "tikt galā," vai "savaldīt," jelkādas sievietes uzvedību. Viņa ir brīva un viņa atbild par savām rīcībām. Sabiedrībai vēl jāpieaug, lai sāktu turēt sievietes pie atbildības par varmācību, krāpšanos, zādzību, utt utt utt.
"Pats izvēlējies" arguments ir ļoti vājš, nepatiess, un "garām." Kamdēļ: jo viņa taču tā neuzvedās, kad viņu izvēlējās Ainārs!
Vai es savu xSievu būtu apprecējis, zinādams, ka viņa savas maģistru studijas viltoja 3 gadus pirms laulājāmies? Protams ka nē -- viņa savu ģimeni, manu ģimeni, visus piemānīja -- un tikai pēc 10 gadiem atklājās, ka viņa ir profi un vispāri ļoti augsta līmeņa krāpniece. Es to nezināju -- es tādu neizvēlējos -- un Ainārs arī nē.
Ainārs man stāstīja par savu sapņaino dzīvi kā bio lauksaimieks ar skaistiem bērniem un brīnišķīgu sievu. Tad "kaut kas" ielauzās.
Tas notiek un iespējams, ka Diāna pati cieš. Dziļi.
Bet ko dara draugi? Draugi atbalsta draudzību draugā -- nevis noziegumus draugā. Patiesiskumu un labestību draugā un sabiedrībā -- nevis "draugu pašu vienalga ko tas cilvēks dara."
Mums ir jāpieag, paīstam, kā sabiedrība, un ir jābeidz upurus vainot par agresoru rīcībām. Mums ir jāizbeidz jaukt seku ar cēloni.
Viņa atbild par savām rīcībām un Ainārs ir ļoti drosmīgs vīrišķīgs vīrietis dēļ tā, ka šādi dalās.

Hello, welcome to Ryanair, my name is Manasseh H and today I will be taking care of your case. I need a moment to familiarize myself with your request. In the meantime, could you please confirm your full name?


Dainis W. Michel, my daughter is Emilija Michel, she has a flight tomorrow Riga-VIenna, but my xWife is saying it is not safe in Vienna at all and is asking us to postpone the flght...how would that work? what is the RyanAir official stance on the flooding in Austria
Manasseh H
i am so sorry to hear about that, you may change the flight time and date by yourself online because you wouldn't be able to get a refund as Ryanair is a non refundable company.  flight change fee is 45 per passenger per flight plus any fare difference.


sounds like a new ticket would be less expensive, but is that flight even flying tomorrow?
Manasseh H
i understand, in case you haven't received any email confirmation the cancellation then the flight is still operational. is there anything else i can help you with please ?
Manasseh H
in case the flight will be cancelled yes we always send confirmation however if you haven't then she should go and take the flight as it is operational.
is there anything else i can help you with please ?


what if there is flooding from the airport to the city? 

like what if you are able to land, but that would cause my daughter to be stranded?
Manasseh H
i understand your concern , but we cannot do anything as for now.  because the flight is operational we cannot cancel it or give you a refund . again the only other option is to change the flight. is there anything else i can help you with please ?



It's evil to absorb and then spread lies about another person. 

Ir ĻAUNI uzņemt no kopējas paziņas tīrus, šķīstus, melnus melus par citu cilvēku - tad tam cilvēkam (man), tos melus pārmest FaceBookā - un vēl, Eva, mana meita tieši uz Taviem pārmetumiem uzrakstīja un iesniedza vēstuli Latvijas policijai. 

Tas, ko Tev par mani iestāstīja -- bija melni un patiešām ļauni samelots. Iedomājies, mana mamma arī Tavus melus par manu meitu un mani kā Tēvu, un par manām attiecībām ar manu xSievu -- arī izlasīja -- un arī policijai vēstuli iesniedza atspēkojot Tavus safabricētos melus. 

Latvijas policija nav vēl lietas sakārtojusi -- bet Austrijas gan. Cilvēku melni apmelot, nobloķēt un vēl sabiedrībā apmelnot -- ir dziļi ļaunas rīcības, un lai melu inde melotājus indē -- nevis apmelotos. 

Ja vēlies "strīdēties," varu labprāt manas meitas un mammas vēstules policijai šeit augšuplādēt.










yeah, i looked into this one several years ago. he made a similar gesture fairly frequently. 

you are right, the photo is quite telling: 

there is no context
the meaning is scripted and dictated to you in a caption 
you are urged to not look any deeper into the claims
you are supposed to have an emotional reaction
if you do look deeper, you will be belittled, berated, and ostracized 

it's the same with the Central Park 5, the "good people on both sides," now with the cat and dog eating, even the felonies. 

if you look into it, you are kicked out of the group, yelled at, demeaned, and ostracized. 

oh, remember that Telemundo reporter - that Trump actually let back into that press conference? 

Doc, Kamala used typical not-so-covert, malignant narcissistic abuse tactics in the debate. We have to make our voting decisions based on factors like: policy, the predictability of world peace, the economy, and the health of US residents. 





Ar meitiņu, Ainār, gandrīz aizbraucām, bet tur bija daži cilvēki, kas tik vienaldzīgi izturējās pret neiespējami ļaunām rīcībām, kuras ar meitu un manu mammu Latvijā izcietām, ka šoreiz izvēlējos nedoties konfrontācijā. 

Nav tikai "agresori, upuri, un glābēji" bet ir arī "blakus esošie/skatītāji," un šoks, ka tik graujošu ļaunumu -- vienkārši noskatās -- un neko nedara -- tas man/manai mazai mīļģimenītei -- ir bijis ļoti sāpīgs. 

Es nesaredzu skaistu nākotni Latvijai, ja mēs viens otram nepalīdzam, ja neatbalsta draudzību draugā -- ja neiestājās par patiesiskumu un savstarpēju labvēlību. 

Tikai, jo esmu 3. paaudzes "bijušās trimdas" latvietis, un mana meita 4. paadze, nenozīmē ka mēs neesam cilvēki, un ka vienkārši esam prom-metami objekti. 

Ja Tu smēli mīlestību, līdzjūtību...nu, tad priecājos.

 Fear of Your Parents' Old Age 

"There  is a break in the family history, where the ages accumulate and  overlap, and the natural order makes no sense: it’s when the child  becomes the parent of their parent."
It’s when the father grows older and begins to move as if he were walking through fog. Slowly, slowly, imprecisely.
It’s when one of the parents who once held your hand firmly when you were little no longer wants to be alone.
It’s when the father, once strong and unbeatable, weakens and takes two breaths before rising from his seat.
It’s  when the father, who once commanded and ordered, now only sighs, only  groans, and searches for where the door and window are—every hallway now  feels distant.
It’s when one of the parents, once willing and hardworking, struggles to dress themselves and forgets to take their medication.
And we, as their children, will do nothing but accept that we are responsible for that life.
The life that gave birth to us depends on our life to die in peace.
Every child is the parent of their parent's death. Perhaps the old age of a father or mother is, curiously, the final pregnancy.
Our last lesson. An opportunity to return the care and love they gave us for decades.
And  just as we adapted our homes to care for our babies, blocking power  outlets and setting up playpens, we will now rearrange the furniture for  our parents.
The first  transformation happens in the bathroom. We will be the parents of our  parents, the ones who now install a grab bar in the shower.
The grab bar is emblematic. The grab bar is symbolic. The grab bar inaugurates the "unsteadiness of the waters."
Because the shower, simple and refreshing, now becomes a storm for the old feet of our protectors.
We cannot leave them for even a moment.
The  home of someone who cares for their parents will have grab bars along  the walls. And our arms will extend in the form of railings.
Aging  is walking while holding onto objects; aging is even climbing stairs  without steps. We will be strangers in our own homes. We will observe  every detail with fear and unfamiliarity, with doubt and concern.
We will be architects, designers, frustrated engineers. How did we not foresee that our parents would get sick and need us?
We will regret the sofas, the statues, and the spiral staircase. We will regret all the obstacles and the carpet.
Happy  is the child who becomes the parent of their parent before their death,  and unfortunate is the child who only appears at the funeral and  doesn't say goodbye a little each day.
My friend *Joseph Klein accompanied his father until his final moments.
In  the hospital, the nurse was maneuvering to move him from the bed to the  stretcher, trying to change the sheets when Joe shouted from his seat:  Let me help you. He gathered his strength and, for the first time, took  his father into his arms. He placed his father's face against his chest.
He  cradled his father, consumed by cancer: small, wrinkled, fragile,  trembling. He held him for a long time, the time equivalent to his  childhood, the time equivalent to his adolescence, a long time, an  endless time. By Your Side Nothing Hurts
Rocking his father back and forth. Caressing his father. Calming his father. And he said softly:

 I'm here, I'm here, Dad! "What a father wants to hear at the end of his life is that his child is there."
I love you, Dad, wherever you are, I always think of you, I will never forget you...

Dear Calvin and Gueillant, praise God, I feel blessed to be communicating with you!

You know, an interesting sequence of searches has led me to contact you. I am the son of a Pastor and Biblical scholar, and I have a curious nature. My Dad left behind 87 lectures about the Old Testament that I did have digitized...but that may be a matter to discuss another day. 

Today I am writing, because I wanted to follow-up on the situation brewing regarding Haitian immigrants capturing and eating animals traditionally not used for food in the USA. 

For me, my heart aches that the immigrants are being laughed at. Also, I do not understand why they are in the USA in such large numbers, especially in small towns. 

Clearly, people Haitian immigrants will be using all kinds of animals, including their neighbors' pets, cats, dogs, along with geese and ducks found in parks. Wouldn't it make sense for people practicing Vodou to use their neighbors' pets?

We clearly have differing paths and standards, and residents of the USA are not to hunt park ducks/geese, and killing and eating the dogs and cats in the neighborhood is considered quite awful behavior -- but with prayer and understanding and assimilation -- it is likely that God can turn the hearts of not just those who've eaten their neighbors' pets, but the hearts of the criminals as well. 

I am seeking validation that it is indeed plausible that the Haitian immigrants have captured and killed their neighbors' pets. Now I do acknowledge that it is wrong -- but it is also understandable -- and that is why I find the mockery of the Haitians in the USA so unfortunate and unfair. 

At any rate, I'd gladly call you on the phone to talk more -- and I am fascinated that your city -- has the name that is the same as my last name. 

Here are my phone numbers:

LV: +37128348987
ÖS: +436605157333
USA: +17732883889

...and my email is dainis@dainis.net

I am not a missionary, but I can say that I find truth, compassion, and accountability to be very important for the healing of our world. When people lie about others -- and mock them -- due to their own lack of understanding about their traditions and habits -- I do feel a bit angry.

I look forward to hearing from you!

Best, 
Dainis W. Michel

https://fb.watch/uyvto8Fl8a/

it's is sooo racist to think that Haitian immigrants wouldn't practice their religion, culture, and folkloric traditions their way! 

Other cultures are different from ours. 

South Korea
In South Korea, cat meat was historically brewed into a tonic as a folk remedy for neuralgia and arthritis, not commonly as food. Modern consumption is seen and more likely to be in the form of cat soup, though the number of people who consume cat soup is considered minimal, compared to a relatively popular dog meat.

Julien Dugnoille wrote in The Conversation that cat meat is mostly consumed by middle-aged working-class women for perceived health benefits, and that usually 10 cats are needed to produce a small bottle of cat, or goyangi, soju (an alcoholic elixir thought to keep arthritis at bay for a few weeks at a time).

According to In Defense of Animals, 100,000 cats are killed yearly to make cat soju in South Korea. Cats are not farmed for their meat in the country, so the trade involves ferals and strays. Nonetheless, the trade is mostly done underground, and the great majority of the population is not even aware that cat consumption exists in the country. Moreover, eating cat meat is highly stigmatized throughout the country, unlike eating dog meat, which is often criticized but not universally stigmatized.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_meat



Steph Tanner i am saying that considering it "ludicrous" that such a thing would even be happening comes from a racist mind. clearly, it's not OK (in our culture), but it is also understandable that such events would take place. it's even predictable. 

that "the Internet" is exploding with mockery of Trump's shock, calling him "unhinged," and posting "eating your cat for lunch" memes, etc., is only possible because of racism. 

you have to be a racist to post such mocking ha ha ha eat your cat memes, because if you were culturally sensitive, you would realize that people do need to acclimate to new cultural environments. 

it's racist to be "shocked" that they would behave in accordance with their traditions. it's also absolutely predictable that such culture clashes would occur, if you ship 10s of thousands of such immigrants --- to small towns. to then "laugh" at and seek to suppress such events...is unconscionable.

TikTok is literally exploding with eyewitness accounts and even police body cam footage.

Trump and his followers are nuts! They believe every bullshit story that comes their way. It’s pathetic.


Sasha Rubel
Gerard Raether I’m never quite sure they believe the lies and BS stories so much as they profess to believe them. Some kind of twisted loyalty test and also a contrarianism
I’m opposite what you are, basically



Dainis W. Michel
Gerard Raether if it's about immigrants killing their neighbors' pets as well as ducks in parks, those reports and even videos have made it to Europe, where i live. i think it is perfectly understandable that people from different cultures and social systems would behave in ways foreign to ours. i can check again, and the internet nowadays has a way of changing even under your own fingertips (regional results, personalized results, etc.).
if you like, i can see if i can find the videos i've seen over the last few weeks reporting immigrants in the USA killing their neighbors' pets and hunting the ducks at local parks.
it was reported in the kind of ha ha ha look at America twist that i wind up confronting fairly frequently. there is quite a bit of, let's say, antipathy, towards American exceptionalism, abroad.




Gerard Raether
Dainis W. Michel This explains the story, which is nonsense.
https://www.nbcnews.com/.../trump-pushes-baseless-claim...



NBCNEWS.COM
Trump pushes baseless claim about immigrants 'eating the pets'
Trump pushes baseless claim about immigrants 'eating the pets'


Dainis W. Michel
Gerard Raether publishing a story that claims something is "baseless," when i saw several "news story" videos, reporting on exactly the behaviors and incidents, let's say "alleged," is pretty strange.
i saw these reports. it also makes sense that such immigrants would exhibit such behavior.
why wouldn't someone catch and kill park pond ducks -- if the ducks are right there and quite portly -- and the cost of meat in the store is ridiculously high?
Gerard, i don't know if we know each other personally or not -- but i saw these news stories. I live in Austria and Latvia alternately.
In Austria, there are strict hunting guidelines, but foraging for chestnuts and wild garlic, literally happens within the city territory, and i lived close to several edible chestnut trees, and the Chinese family that runs one of the Chinese restaurants would go and gather them. i helped a friend of mine gather wild garlic behind Schloss Schönbrunn (for the organic pesto he sold at his shop), and the immigrants love those "secret" spots. you save money by foraging. i used to go eat wild berries in Vienna all the time.
why on earth would these immigrants not eat the park ducks?
i can also say, i have now watched about 20 min of the debate. i regret being drawn in to US politics -- i feel obliged to do so because i am a voter and i do plan on voting.
But immigrants killing park pond ducks? Immigrants eating their neighbors pets? These are actual election talking points?
Also, to consider such behavior "possible" is reasonable. Many people live completely disconnected from what we eat -- and in other countries they will grab a chicken by its neck/head and twist the chicken's head off, thereby killing it so that it can be eaten. Lots of people live in environments that are not disconnected from nature or the actual sources of the food they eat.
I find it perfectly plausible that immigrants ate park ducks. The stories about the neighbors' pets are a bit wild, but I'm a 1st generation American, and my parents were both refugees. I've definitely heard eye witness accounts from WWII refugees that are much worse than eating a neighbor's pet.
Isn't it a bit racist to not think immigrants would eat park ducks? They're right there...and totally fat. It's like thinking they're not going to go fishing without permits. They have no idea about "permits." They're going to go out and spear some river trout -- if they can -- especially if they come from a region that does that.
The ducks and the trout - within the territory of Vienna, Austria - possibly because hunting is illegal and fishing permits are expensive - are really fat and big. They don't have any predators...
Anyway, I saw the news reports. I can try to dig them up, but I find it utterly and I mean utterly absurd that essentially my first "serious" dip into US politics, in an effort to make a sound voting decision, will be to check if immigrants in the USA ate their neighbors' pets.

Alīna, ar Tevi esmu iepazinies, kā sirsnīgu cilvēku ar labiem nolūkiem. Ja šādus pasākumus rīko drošā vidē, noteikti skaisti izdosies. 

Bet ja šādus pasākumu rīko: Zaļā vilā, Elpārēs, vai “Dievkalnos,” intensīvi no dvēseles dziļumiem vēlu, lai apmeklētājiem nenotiktos traumatizējumi, kurus mana meita un es piedzīvojām, saskaroties un diemžēl uz ne visai īsi laiku, iepinoties, ar šiem tumšiem, ļauniem, postošiem, Siguldas ļaudīm. 

Eva: Ligija Tev par mani MELOJA. Vai gribi lai es šeit, šajā poustā ielieku vēstules, kuras mana meita un mamma uzrakstīja policijai — reaģējot uz un atspēkojot Tavus un Ligijas MELUS par manīm?

Andri: es VĒL gribu savas mantas atpakaļ. Kā Tu vispāri spēj naktīs gulēt, nedarot itin neko, lai būtu patiess, labvēlīgs, un skaidrs iznākums? Tu vadīsi jogu? Tu? 

Es NEKAD savai meitai neesmu darījis pāri. Ne savai meitai ne savai xSievai — itin nekādā veidā! 

Diemžēl, Latvijas policija nav bijusi tik sakarīga un taisnīga, kā Austrijas policija, savādīgi, jau pret dažiem no jums būtu kriminālprocesi. 

Sargājiet jūsu bērnus. Lai melu inde melotājus indē nevis apmelotos. 

Alīna: šādus festivālus noteikti būtu jauki rīkot vidē kur bērniem un ģīmenēm ir droši. Zaļā villa noteikti, skatoties uz manas pieredzes, tāda nav.


#Negritude, African Literature and Language Choice#
Expectations:
1. What is negritude? How did it come about?
2. What is African Literature? What gave rise to this variety of World literature?
3. Language debate in African Literature; which language should Africans use in expressing their experience and their literary works?
(1) Negritude:
Negritude is a  cultural, political and literary movement that began around 1930, spread through, 40s, and gain extrem popularity in the  ’50s.
 At the out set, in the literary world, it began among French-speaking African and Caribbean writers living in Paris as a protest against French colonial rule and the policy of assimilation. Assimilation is a colonial policy, that aimed at transforming all Africans (particularly those in “French” colonies) by either luring or forcing them to integrate,  adapt and practice the way of life of the French people. It a policy that intended turning all Africans into black French men and women. To accomplish this goal, France had to eliminate all African cultures and assimilate all Africans into French culture. This policy never sat well with many Africans because it surpressed all the distinctive characteristics an Africans and this resulted to an intellectual protest.
 Negritude was majorly promoted by Léopold Sédar Senghor ( the first elected president of the Republic of Senegal in 1960) 
Some of the major principles of Negritude are: 
1. Celebration of Black culture and identity
2. Resistance to colonialism, racism, and oppression
3. Emphasis on the unique experiences and perspectives of Black people
4. Rejection of Eurocentric values and norms
5. Promotion of African and Caribbean cultures as equal to European cultures
In Literature, Negritude writers emphasized the following;
1. "Blackness" as a source of pride and strength
2. The importance of African and Caribbean heritage
3. The struggle for decolonization and independence
4. The role of literature and art in promoting social change
Major Contributors:
1. Léopold Sédar Senghor (Senegal)
2. Aimé Césaire (Martinique)
3. Frantz Fanon (Martinique)
4. Léon Gontran Damas (French Guiana)
5. Jacques Roumain (Haiti)
Negritude's legacy:
1. Inspired African and Caribbean writers to explore their cultural identities
2. Influenced the development of African literature and postcolonial studies
3. Contributed to the global fight against colonialism and racism
4. Shaped the Black Arts Movement in the United States
5. Continues to inspire contemporary debates on identity, culture, and social justice.
Conclusion:
Negritude's impact extends beyond literature to art, music, and politics, making it a significant cultural and intellectual movement of the 20th century.

Chad Gard, if I am understanding you correctly, you are saying that he wrote checks, or his business/legal team wrote checks, in 2017, and that labeling what clearly look to be legal expenses, as legal expenses, amounted to “falsifying business records,” even though the records are right there — for everyone to see — and they are not “falsified.” The expenses actually happened, and the payments were actually made. 

“Falsifying” business records, for example, is what corrupt politicians do. They get millions to, for example, build something - and they submit all kinds of false records to make it look like that something was built — and then either that something never gets built at all — or a lesser version of the something gets built, photographed, and abandoned. The falsified business records in that case would be a pile of bills paid to contractors, materials purchased — fake names — shell companies — and those contractors do not exist as people. The materials were never purchased. The money is then shuffled around, and if it can be traced, sometimes, the perpetrators go to jail. There’s a pile of fake bills, receipts, payments, etc. 

In Trump’s case — the expenses not only went to the people mentioned, but the purpose is also correct. There are no “fake companies” that received money. The correct people are cited, and the correct purpose is cited. Where is the crime?

Maybe let’s try with a few clear examples…

To use the example of stealing a car, to “not” have committed the crime, the thief would simply need to have not stolen the car. 

In Trump’s case: what is the thing that he did, that was a crime, that had he not done, he would not be a criminal? Also: how should he have labeled those checks then?

Someone claiming that this case proves that Trump is a criminal must be able to take all of the “elements” of the case — and rearrange the elements — so that no crime would have been committed. Can you do that? 

Let’s consider not only theft (where simply: not stealing would then not be a crime), let’s also consider arson. 

In the theft of a car, the thief would have needed to have not stolen the car — then there would have been no crime. To make “arson” into “not arson,” then the fire needs to never have been set. If there was no intentionally set fire — then there could not have been arson. 

Are you following?

You would have to be able to show a “non-crime” version of Trump’s behavior, if you’re claiming that he committed a crime. 

Now, you’re claiming that somehow, these invoices, entries, and checks “prove” that Trump falsified business records. How? How do these checks prove Trump falsified any business records?

Let’s grab an example:

“11
Guilty
Invoice from Michael Cohen, marked as a record of Donald J. Trump	
May 22, 2017”

That’s an invoice. How does that specific invoice prove the crime Donald Trump was convicted of?

Next, this alleged falsification, which happened in 2017, somehow proves that Trump not only conspired to influence an election, but that he hid election interference?

WHAT?

Don’t you think a felony should be clear and understandable — not a long string of assumptions and claims where every step of the way, the claims don’t make any sense?

Shouldn’t you be able to clearly explain what the crime even was — and also — shouldn’t you be able to explain what Trump would have needed to have done, so that these checks would not be: 

1) falsifying business records in 2017, that
2) supposedly proves that he intentionally hid his 
3) 2016 election interference 

and at the end of it…somehow all of this has to do with “sex with a porn star?” 

So?

Please put the “elements” of this case into a sequence that a) makes Trump into a criminal and b) would have made Trump into “not a criminal.”

















Are you familiar with the “Let Them” theory?  
I’ll tell you the more I grow the more I am okay with accepting the “Let Them” in my own life and relationships. Even family can mistreat and disrespect you.  
This is something that took me a very long time to learn.  I used to tolerate a lot because I didn't want to lose people. I learned the hard way if they were really my people they would never treat me like that.  Don't make the mistake of being so understanding and forgiving that you overlook the fact that you're being repeatedly disrespected.  
Let them be upset.
Let them judge you.
Let them misunderstand you. 
Let them gossip about you,
Let them ignore you.
Let them be "right."
Let them doubt you.
Let them not like you.
Let them not speak to you.
Let them run your name in the ground.
Let them make you out to be the villain.
Whatever it is that people want to say about you, let them! 
Kindly step aside and LET THEM.
The hard truth is they know how much they are hurting you. They just simply don't care. They did it knowing it could cause them to lose you. They did it anyway.  People that love you care about how they make you feel. 
The end. 
Let them go. 
There will be people that would rather lose you than be honest about what they've done to you. Let them go.
The lack of respect was the closure.  The lack of apology was the closure.  The lack of care was the closure. The lack of acountability was the closure. The lack of honestly was the closure.  Let them go. 
Make the decision to no longer sit at tables where you might be the topic when you get up. Let them go. 
You can still be kind. You can even still love them deeply. But do it from the distance they created in their words and actions. Access to you is a privilege they have proven they can’t be trusted with. Let them go. 
You don’t need to tell your side of the story. God already knows. Let God fight the battle for you. Let them go. 
It’s taken me a long time to get here. Sleepless nights, countless tears, managing a range of emotions filled with anger, disappointment, confusion and deep hurt.  Lots of self reflection, self preservation, deep prayer and seeking wisdom from those much wiser than me.  
If you are struggling with this please know you are not alone.  We will never understand why hurt people hurt people. But we can do the hard work to grow ourselves.  Because healed people do in fact heal people. 
Don’t you dare let them steal your joy. 
Don’t you dare let them steal your light. 
Don’t you dare let them steal your peace. 
You are in control of that. 
Hold tight to what you can control and release your grip on what you can’t control.
Let them go.

NARCTEST
Jacob has revealed the one question to ask someone to see if they have the condition too (TikTok/@thenamelessnarcissist)
Do you think that there are just objectively better and worse people in the world, and people who are superior and inferior and the rest of the world just wants to ignore that?
He explained: "Even better if you add something implying that you and that person are both part of the like upper echelons.
"Narcissists view the world through that lens, through the ideas that there are people who have more inherent self-worth and some people who have less self-worth, people who are better than other people and people who are worse.
"That is a central core belief that drives their actions. And it is why constantly they're trying to prove that they are part of the better people because, deep down, they think they're part of the worst people."

Varbūt bijāt redzējuši, ka kontstruēju vākus, ar kuriem viegli varēja pagājušās dziesmu svētku kora notis ar vienu roku turēt, un ik pa laiciņu ērti šķirstīt: 

https://www.tiktok.com/@dainisw.michel/video/7208734759965560069

Pats esmu: komponists, kora diriģents, un vēl nepabeigtās disertācijas tēma ir mūzikas kompozīcijas apmācīšana. 

Varu sevi gan nosaukt par “mūzikas nošu bildes” augsta līmeņa ekspertu. 

Esmu grāmatu par dziesmu nošu rakstīšanu uzrakstījis: https://dainis.net/learn-how-to-write-your-songs-down

un mani studenti un lasītāji ir piedzīvojuši izteiktu veiksmi un gandarījumu. 

Jau vairāk nekā 20 gadus koncentrējos uz nošu bilžu skaistumu, lasāmību un precizitāti. 

Daži eksemplāri šeit: https://dainis.net/music/score-bookshelf/

Vai varbūt vēlamies sarunāt atalgotu darbiņu man, lai es izveidotu patiešām skaistu, viegli lasāmu, veikli un viegli turāmu, laika apstākļos izturīgu — nošu grāmatiņu 2028. gada dziesmu svētkiem?

Protams varu arī atbalstīt tagadējo publikācijas procesu…apskatīties, slīpēt, pārdomāt…uzlabot!

Sirsnībā un pateicībā par jūsu lielo darbu mūsu kultūras pastāvēšanai…

Andris Strapcāns ir cilvēks ar kuru 16. oktobrī 2021. gadā FB mesendžerī čatoju, vaicājot vai viņš nebija iespējamais bērniņa Tēvs, kas nedzima -- kuru Ligija man prezentēja kā mūsu bērniņu pēc 2021. gada Jāņiem. 

Ligijai līdz šai dienai ir manas mantas. Andris Strapcāns bija un joprojām ir pozīcijā noskaidrot, vai Ligija tīšām veicināja manas meitas laupīšanu 2021. g. 2. aprīlī, vai varbūt viņai samaksāja -- vai tiešām bija sagadīšanāš. 

Andris būtu varējis palīdzēt gan noskaidrot laupīšanas krimināllietu, gan palīdzēt atbildēt par bērniņu, gan vienkārši noturēt ētisku stāju, ka man pienākās iespēja savākt SAVAS mantas no Ligijas mājas, kuras biju atstājis, kamēr viņa mani bija pārcliecinājusi, ka esmu mīlēts, lai es uzticojoties, lai es atverojoties, un lai es viņas mājas saucu par savām. 

Šī grupiņa ar cilvēkiem, bez pārspīlējuma, nopietni traumēja gan mani, gan manu meitu, gan manu mammu. Emīte tagad ir divus gadus gājusi terapijā — un vēl neesam pilnīgi atkopušies. 

Emīte ir jau 2x aizrakstījusi Latvijas policijai vēstules, lai atspēkotu LigijasZ un Evas Strapcānes melus par manīm un viņu. 

Paldies Dievam, ka gan Austrijas policija, gan Austrijas tiesa — palīdzēja. 

Andra xSieva mani brīdināja, ka Andris is zaglis, dēmons, ka viņai ir žēl, ka viņš ir viņu bērniņa Tēvs, un ka viņš noteikti būtu varējis organizēt fizisko uzbrukumu pret manīm 2021. 16. oktōbrī, kuru izpildīja puiši RPP uniformās, bet kuri par policistu protokolu zināja nulli — un kuri mani gandrīz nogalināja. Bet tad, Evai, Andra xSievai, Ligija tāāāā sameloja, ka Eva mani sabāra un nobloķēja.

Vide ar tik tumšiem cilvēkiem, kas vai nu tīšām vai netīšām veicināja manas meitas laupīšanu un traumēšanu — kas vēl MELO policijai par mani un Emīti — nav droša vide. Itsevišķi ne ģimenēm un ne bērniem.

Hey, 

I’m doing some soul-searching and am essentially, “assessing” my friendships. 

With FB becoming more and more restrictive, it’s important for us to share our email addresses, phone numbers, and even our physical addresses with each other — if we’d like to stay in touch. Also, I’d like to know what kind of reciprocation you’re interested in.

Can I help you in any way? Can you support or help me?

Es tagad iziešu pastaigā, bet diemžēl, nevaru pateikt, ka sevišķi “labi” iet. 

Visu savu mūžu esmu paspējis ļoti ļoti labus rezultātus. Ir labi draugi. Daždažādās sacencībās esmu uzvarējis. 

Bet kopš piedzīvojuma ar siguldieti, man vienkārši neiet. OK, atdevu atdevu atdevu visu — meditēju Dievam lūdzu utt — un kaut kādīgi tajā burbulī uzvinnēju Tīrradnī — kuri mani neaicijāja uz koncertu, kurā piedalīsies Kārlis Kazāks un vesels bars no dalībniekiem. 

Pieņemu, ka Kārlis Kazāks tīšām nokārtoja, ka es nepiedalītos. 

Emīte būs svētdienas rītā, bet komunicējot ar viņu, vienkārši sanāk bēdas bēdas un vēl bēdas un bēdas. Viņas māte nav normāla, un man vajag kaudzi ar naudu manas xSievas trakošanu un negatīvo ietekmi atspēkot — bet šobrīd — vienkārši sanāk tā — ka jūtos tākā slīkstu. 

Manu sistēmu joprojām grauj: Emīte laupīta, es izvarots, vai bij bērniņš — tad mani gandrīz nogalināja. 

Ummm…kas notikās? Es neizlecu no Ligjias automašīnas un visa mana dzīve ir izpostīta?

OK, bet kur ir Dieva palīdzība? Kur bija Dieva aizsardzība? 

…man šodien zvanīja nepazīstams numurs. Es atzvanīju — tur atbild — tad vienkārši pakar. 

Vienkārši ļoti spēcīga vēlme pēc Dieva palīdzības — pēc veiksmes — un salīdzinājums starp to kā būtu bijis, ja vienkārši būtu izlecis no Ligijas mašīnas — un to kā ir — mani grauj. 





Emītei šodien lūdza piedalīties vienā “sporta” paveidā Vīnē — viņa gandrīz mainīja uz voleju. Ja būtu volejs, tad viņa būtu gan Latvijā, gan Austrijā. 

Tagad viņa būs Svētdien, bet nav mums vairs kopējā sapņa…Omīte iestādīs tomātus, Emītei būs sava istabiņa un nokrāsos sienas. 

Ligija vienkārši visu mūsu dzīvi izpostīja — un Emīte ir pieradusi pie bezatbildības

Nu…kopš jaukās saspēles, it kā “visu laiku” gribēju atrakstīt mesadžiņu…pateikties…

…un nu, bija arī klubā viens man ļoti nelabvēlīgs cilvēks (“Meža Roberts,” no Trejdeviņu nometnēm, kas nosauca manas dziesmas ar tautiskiem tekstiem, itsevišķi tās veltītas bērniem, par “mūsu tautas puvumu”), un ja būtu kādi jautājumi par mani vai manu situāciju, tad vēlētos ar jums tos izrunāt/pārrunāt.

…diemžēl, par mani ir arī sabiedrībā melots, un man ir bijis ļoti grūti ar to tikt galā. 

Ja jums būtu kaut kas negatīvs par mani teikts, itsevišķi par mani kā Tēvu, es jums būtu ļoti pateicīgs, ja jūs man pateiktu kuŗš ko ir teicis, jo tik melni tikt aprunātam — nu esmu tagad iesniedzis kriminālapsūdzības, centienos, lai tas apstātos un Emīte ir 2x policijai vēstules rakstījusi…

…gribēju arī ieteikt kādu mēģinājumu pirms rītdienas. Man nākšot maza grupiņa ar sajūsminātām dejotājām :-) 

Būtu jauki pārrunāt arī vajadzīgo/iespējas/jūtas/domas/mūziku…

…man piem brūvējās sadziedāšanas albumiņš (ģimenēm/bērniem)…

Diemžēl varu pateikt, ka piedzīvotā varmācība ir atstājusi ilgstošas traumas, kuras ir bijis grūti nokratīt.  

Nu labi…par rītdienu…

Bija daži danči, viens tikai Re un La, bet nu man tiešām nebija ne jausmas, kad pāriet no viena akorda uz nākošā — tākā bija uz 2 man liekās…bet tad varbūt uz 1, bet tad atkal uz 2?

Šovakar patiešām ir silts un jauks vakars…bet nu…vai man atbraukt pie jums rīt uz dažām stundām…un tad mēs uz centru kopā? Vai šovakar uz kādu laiciņu?

Es labprāt “visu” sev arī izrakstītu un izdrukātu, un šovakar/rīt varu ieklausīties/saprast…daļēji arī izrakstīt…

Nav man vēl ļoti labs jodels izgudrots austrietim…

Apmēram tā…







Aigars Ālītis Viņi nezin ka bērnu laupīšana, varmācība, mantu piesavināšana, un cilvēku apmelošana ir ļaunas rīcības? 

Viņi nesaprot, cik sāpīgi ir vīrietim nezināt, vai viņa xDraudzene abortēja bērniņu, 

Kā viņi var nezināt, ka apmelot policiju par otru cilvēku un vēl sūtīt melīgas vēstules bāriņtiesai par to cilvēku (mani) nav ļauni? 

Būtu ļoti skaisti, ja šī Siguldas banda būtu naīvi un nesaprastu cik postoša bija viņu





When dealing with narcissism, you should know that it's not personal. "It isn't personal" is one of those cliches used to cushion all kinds of bad actions taken by people who need an out for being immoral, but in this case it actually gets near the truth. Narcissists don't know how to love or be a friend; they can't afford to spare the energy to learn, because they're always in a state of high emergency, cataloging potential threats and redoubling their defenses. When they claim to love you, it means nothing. They may even think they mean it, but they don't understand the concept - they can't feel it. They never attach to you or anyone else. Other people are paper cut-outs to the narcissist, like those cardboard figures of celebrities you pose next to for a selfie. Narcissist value their own children only as mirrors of themselves. When they destabilize you or attack you, it means nothing. They are stuck in an endless conversation with themselves, in which you are an inanimate object, to be assigned their own faults and used as a surrogate punching bag for their hatred of themselves. When they toss you out, it's no more meaningful than a junkie tossing away a needle; when they try to reel you back in, it only means that they tired of the new drug and need a hit of the old. None of this is personal. They're too terrified to have personal relationships, opting instead for extraction of admiration from a subservient partner whose range of action they strictly constrain. This is not personal. None of it. The narcissist does not know who you are. it doesn't know how to know other people. Like the vampire or the chainsaw-wielding creature in the horror film, it's from another world, bereft of the concept of human connection. Moreover, People wonder why they end up hurt, seriously hurt, and even killed for their own actions. Cheating is a choice and there's simply a lot of ignorance in the process....

“1. When I came to you with my idea for a BLM glove, you wanted to do  Go Fund Me campaign to raise $30K. “


That’s not true. 


“I felt that was unethical because I didn’t need startup money due to my relationship with the manufacturer.”

Generating pre-sales would not have been unethical. It was Kickstarter, and I still have the files. 


“Instead of honoring my wishes, you wanted take my idea and do it on your own. I found that to be hurtful, insensitive, and disrespectful.”

That’s ridiculous, I never wanted to take the idea and do it on my own. If I had “wanted” to do that — I would have done it. 


“You eventually apologized and let the matter go, but you made it clear that you felt I cost us some money.”

What you “cost” us is the chance to make a bit of money, yes. 

“However, I spoke with a few attorney friends of mine who agreed that an unnecessary Go Fund Me would have been unethical. This was the first strain on our friendship.”

Bill, it was a Kickstarter, and I sensed that we had a fairly short time window, and I was right. BLM has descended into allegations of fraud, scam, corruption etc etc. I didn’t know what exactly was going to happen with BLM, but I did correctly assess that we had a short time window. 

We would have taken pre-orders. Your insistence that taking pre-orders is unethical is just not rational. Go to kickstarter — I have purchased several innovative things before product release from kickstarter. It’s lost its initial “coolness” now, but at the time, it was a cool concept, they were promoting BLM products for free, and your concept would have actually come to life, had you just said “yes,” to doing a kickstarter. 

I made the pre-kickstarter, and all you would have needed to do is say “yes,” and the campaign would have launched. If Kickstarters don’t make enough money, they return the money and the campaign is considered “unscuccessful.”

We agreed that no one in your circle would find out about my skin tone. What happened after you told them my skin tone? Everything that came from me was suppressed, not allowed, considered “unethical” etc etc, well OK, instead of sticking to what was happening — and instead of keeping yourself from getting played — you let them convince you to distance yourself from me — because of the color of my skin and how your “friends” treated you because of the color of my skin. 

The BLMgloves project ended, because you told the BLM people that I’m white. 

If “you were right,” then the gloves would be a part of the BLM line-up, and they would have had visibility in the marches, movement, media, etc. They didn’t. You also got played and that has continued to be a source of frustration for me. Your “friend” Marvin is some bigshot millionaire — but you were on unemployment. That really messes with me, Bill. The idea was that we were going to help each other and support each other until we “made it,” and that means millions. 

Would I let you stay on unemployment, if I “made it big,” and received some kind of big up-front money for one of my movie ideas, like this one: https://dainis.net/ideas/movie-idea-the-chicago-five/

Bill, prior to these situations, I clearly would have gotten you on board as a creative on the team. 

Now what?

Did you have anyone backing you to the point of putting aside paid projects and working for you for free? 

No, they ripped you off, took advantage of you, and didn’t let you even do a Kickstarter to get some presales for YOUR idea?

I backed you and your idea fully. I put myself behind it and invested time effort skill equipment etc. Where there is love, friendship — I have done truly miraculous things — and clearly I don’t know how to “design gloves,” but I did for you — and the materials were good enough to get some sales. 

You’d be “right” in this matter, if you had even just a few thousand sales — but you don’t. Your wondeful idea is now buried — and you had a very brief shot. 

A few clicks, and at least the idea would have had a chance on Kickstarter — and Kickstarter campaigns are NOT unethical.

“This constant lying is not aimed at making the people believe a lie, but at ensuring that no one believes anything anymore.

A people that can no longer distinguish between truth and lies cannot distinguish between right and wrong. And such a people, deprived of the power to think and judge, is, without knowing and willing it, completely subjected to the rule of lies.

With such a people, you can do whatever you want.”

—Hannah Arendt, German historian and philosopher (1906–1975)







WHAT WOMEN NEED TO KNOW ABOUT INTIMACY
1. Men find it easier to be close when there is peace. If you are not a peaceful woman, he won't enjoy your presence.
2. It hurts a man when he is accused of cheating, yet he is faithful. Such a man will struggle with intimacy because he feels hurt. Don't accuse him falsely.
3. A stressed man will struggle with his performance and connection because his mind controls his body. Attend to the matters disturbing him so that he doesn't feel alone, and he will find you attractive.
4. Men struggle to kiss the lips of a wife who insults, belittles, and orders him around.
5. No matter how attractive your body is or how hot the lingerie you wear, a man is turned on most by your attitude.
6. Men also love it when the wife makes romantic advances. Don't be passive, letting him do all the work. Take your husband out on dates, seduce him, flirt with him, show him that you find him attractive.
7. Ego is important to a man when it comes to intimacy. Tell him how you enjoy being close with him, and he will do it more. If you mock his performance or make him feel you did not enjoy it, he will feel bruised and withdraw.
8. If issues are keeping you from desiring closeness with your husband, voice them out and talk things out without delay. Don't be indifferent, cold, and give him the silent treatment. Being cold will push him away, and he might form a negative opinion of you, ruining the delicate fabric of your intimacy for a long time.
9. Appreciating his efforts and showing gratitude will make him feel valued and more connected to you.
10. Sharing your own desires and being open about what makes you feel loved will help him understand and respond to your needs better.



Paldies, Eduard, jā, tas maksājums ir no manīm. Man likās, ka ePastā skaidroju, ka visi personīgie Eiropas konti bija kovidarēras ietvaros jālikvidē. 

Koknesē, tiekoties ar Annu un Gunti Nulle, sanāca tā, ka it kā mani aicina uz Limbažu saietu — pateicu, ka bez Emītes, bez atbildībām es tā īsti nevēlētos braukt — un viņiem ienāca prātā vairākas atbildības man. 

Bet no Limbažiem atnāca rēķins par 320 — un vispāri man liekas, ka tiem kas cenšās uz Latviju pārvākties, iespējams iet vēl grūtāk, nekā tādiem, kas vai nu ārzemēs vai Latvijā dzīvo. 

Šodien, varu 190 pārskaitīt, bet mazlietiņ nezinu ko darīt — izmazgāšu veļu — Emīte šobrīd Latvijā nav — vispāri būtu ļoti jauki aizbraukt uz Limbažiem, bet nu 190 par Limbažiem varu samaksāt, bet 380 šodien tā īsti nesanāk. 

Man ir vairāki vispāri, pēc plāna, ļoti ienesīgi projekti, un ar diemžēl diezgan saspīlēti gaidu ROI, bet naudiņa ir “sasieta” un neko nevaru darīt. 

 

If you "expand" like that, you can get attacked. Dispenza is allowed to "teach," partially because his techniques allow evil to see the good — more clearly. Then the good can be taken out, attacked, sabotaged, etc. 

You are NOT alone in the Universe, and Dispenza’s victim-blaming is incredibly toxic. 

DO NOT open your heart among the sinister. 

That is like becoming a bright little minnow and swimming out into the depths and thinking you’re safe — you will be eaten, if you follow Dispenza’s advice. 

BE SAFE! 

You must build in safety when practicing such techniques. 












Secret Service counter sniper was ordered to stand down. He wanted to take out the shooter. He instinctively shot and killed the shooter once he started firing at Trump. For that infraction (taking out the would-be assassin), he was fired.
People were alerting both the police and the Secret Service about this kid's weapon and wearabouts. Clearly, the shots were "allowed," which is an incredibly embarrassing breach of security on the world stage.
People in the USA seem to think the events are only about the USA...but this kind of a fiasco has severe global safety repercussions.
I live in a country that shares a border with Russia. Basically, with a USA that weak, the Baltics are in trouble.
Letting a 20 year old kid haul a ladder around and a rifle -- and crawl around on a roof -- while noticed and observed and in the sights of the secret service -- and letting a KID get a shot off -- I mean they could have shot him in the leg, or possibly even apprehended him without injuring him.
Then the oooh the roof was sloped? What????!?!?
The head of the Secret Service of the USA is claiming that the roof was too sloped? WHAT?!?!?!
Absolute and total incompetence regarding the application of force means that our diplomats around the world -- especially in conflict zones -- are now less safe, unless the USA responds in a way that repairs the situation.





aaa, pārgāju uz TT, jo tur kādu laiku necenzēja, nedzēsa manus klipus utt

gan izliku arī FB, bet FB ļoti manipulatīvi apietas ar komentāriem — vienam rāda vienu, citam citu — tamdēļ šobrīd daudz mazāk FB lietoju

https://www.facebook.com/share/p/6AxX1SAreyBVAcgs/




kopš 2020. gada, katru gadu aizrakstu epasta vēstuli visām Latvijas mūzikas skolām…ļoti gribētos atkal pasniegt, kā to Austrijā pirms meitiņas dzimšanas darīju — kur arī profesionāli korus diriģēju…visu bija jāliek malā, lai varētu meitiņu audzināt…

meitiņu būtu varējis audzināt viens, bet nu, xSieva, Ārij, vienkārši ļoti destruktīvi rīkojās…līdz šai dienai…bet meitai drīz būs 18 gadi, tad paldies Dievam, tā dzīves fāze būs beigusies…



īsu īsu mirkli ar Andri Punduru, koris Vivat — “Sit kociņi” diriģēju — tiiiik labi jutās — kā lidot — ritmiskie gabali, Sasala jūriņa…tautiskie, Tiguls,…ļoti manos kaulos rezonē (arī Tavs u ū, no 2013. g. Dz. Sv.). 

patīk diriģēt — austriešiem dažus vieglākus kora gabalus iemācīju…bija skaisti...









Izskatās tā, ka sanāks tipiskā post-padomju latviešu atbilde, kas protams man liek ilgoties pēc bijušās trimdas sirdssiltuma, atvērtības, un sadarbības. Bet tie laiki ir pagājuši. 

Iedomājies, cik briesmīgi būtu, ja tajā grupā liktu video ierakstus, kā bērniņi dara kaut ko tik šausmīgu, kā izveido jaunu danci vai rotaļu?!??! 

Un vēl, ja izveidotos sadarbība un koprade? Šausmas! Visi ir jānoliek savā vietā un jānoraida absolūti viss, kas neiederās uz mata, tā, kā visasākie no grupas to vēlas. 

Varbūt, kā pirmo piemēru vajadzēja likt danci, kuru mana meita sāka izveidot — vai Vītolu ģimenes mazmeitiņas danci…

Varbūt grupas nosaukumu “dančukrātuves jaunumi,” vajadzētu mainīt uz “vecais dančukrātuves arhīvs.”

Meža salas Roberts paguva nosaukt to, “ko es daru,” kā “mūsu tautas puvumu,” un neviens no Trejdeviņiem nav ne mani, ne manu meitiņu aizstāvējuši. 

Iespējams, ka pamēģināšu izveidot jaunu, “pats savu” grupu, Renāta, bet visticamāk to nedarīšu, jo esmu 3. paaudzes bijušās trimdas latvietis — esmu vienīgais no vairākiem tūkstošiem savā vecumā kas cenšās Latvijas anti-sabiedrisko savstarpēju uzvedību izturēt. Man būtu vajadzīgi gaiši, mīļi cilvēki, kas nevis instiktīvi un pēkšņi, kā refleksu, izstumj un noraida…bet tādi draugi, kas mani iekļauj, aizstāv un atbalsta (kā arī viens otru)…

Contact Team No Virus
Translations: English German English Latvian

Hi [FirstName],

Thank you so very much for daring to stand in truth regarding the settling the virus debate. The burden of proof is clearly on those alleging that replication competent pathogenic viruses exist in nature. 

The closer we look, the more clearly we see the flaws…and fraud…of virology. 

At the outset of the convid scandal, I wrote this song: https://open.spotify.com/track/5s8220MAJiY24IpiqAmLUP?si=ca104509511d488c

…and I thought you might like it. 

I actually wound up sacrificing a lot to stand up for individual medical human rights un Latvia — and was nearly killed by young men dressed in police uniforms — for being recognized as “that guy who sings the song questioning the pandemic.”

My videos, music, translations, explanations about systems science, interviews, and commentary, were relentlessly deleted, banned, and censored. 

Apparently, I wrote a song (in Latvian), that many regarded as Latvia’s “Freedom song” during the lockdowns and restrictions…

I thought it might be enjoyable for “Team No Virus” to stick together, so I wanted to get in touch and see about ways we could support each other. 

With Latvia having “come down very hard” on medical human rights advocates, I can admit that I have had a very hard time making ends meet — and in the fray of the plandemic, my daughter got abducted in a way where it’s still not clear to me, if governmental sabotage may not have been involved. 

I thought it might be nice to offer my services to you. Here is my resume: https://dainis.net/business/resume

Seems like it could be reciprocally beneficial for “Team No Virus” to stick together!

Do you have any needs I might be able to help you with? Maybe I could translate “Can You Catch A Cold” into both Latvian and German?

Best, 
Dainis 


In Ancient Greece, Socrates had a great reputation for wisdom. One day, someone came to find the great philosopher and said to him:
"Do you know what I just heard about your friend?"
"A moment," replied Socrates. "Before you tell me, I would like to test it with the three sieves."
"The three sieves?"
"Yes," continued Socrates. "Before you speak about others, it's important to take the time to filter what you mean. I call it the test of the three sieves. The first sieve is TRUTH. Have you checked if what you're going to tell me is true?"
"No, I just heard it."
"Very well! So, you don't know if it's true. Let's move on to the second sieve, that of KINDNESS. Is what you want to tell me about my friend something good?"
"Oh, no! On the contrary."
"So," questioned Socrates, "you want to tell me something negative about him, and you're not even sure it's true? Perhaps you can still pass the test of the third sieve, that of UTILITY. Is it useful for me to know what you're going to tell me about this friend?"
"No, not really."
"Therefore," concluded Socrates, "what you were going to tell me is neither true, nor good, nor useful. Why, then, did you want to tell me this?"
"Gossip is a bad thing. Initially, it may seem enjoyable and fun, but ultimately, it fills our hearts with bitterness and poisons us." - Pope Francis

Varbūt tikai to atklāt pēc tam, ka laba sieviete vīrietim stāv blakus, jo šādus vīriešus atrod plēsoņdvēseļu sievietes, un viņiem izdemolē dzīves.

Dainis W. Michel Bet ja ir otrādi? Ja ir vīrieši,kas izdemolē sievietes dzīves?Ne vienmēr, sievietes visur vainojamas

 Vāji vīrieši vienmēr vainos sievietes,pat tur kur nav saistības viņām!Un protams mēdz būt otrādi arī.Bet nekad viens cilvēks nav vainojams….Jo pie skaistām attiecībām strādā abi.

Bet -- šī siguldiete MELO.
Mana meita ir 2x rakstījusi Latvijas policijai, lai kaut kādīgi apturētu šīs sievietes melus.
Vai manī var atrast jelkādu atbildību, par šīs, manas xDraudzenes uzvedību?

Kādas vieglākas kādas sarežģītākas ,bet visas ir bijušas vērtīgas. Sievietes man ir daudz iemācījušas. Un es mācos vēljoprojām. Visa pasaule griežas dēļ mīlestības draugs...

Artūrs Strauts Artūr, atbildīgie, personīgi un individuāli atbild par viņu rīcībām, arī attiecībās.
Tikai jo divi cilvēki ir attiecībās -- nenozīmē, ka pēkšņi ir kopēja atbildība.
Tā sapratne ir patiešām mūsu tautai svarīga: nē, mēs kā tauta "nepievilkām" K. Kariņa absurdās rīcības kovidafēras laikā -- viņš atbild par viņa uzvedību, punkts.
Ja vīrietis/sieviete paceļ roku pret pārtneri -- sitējs vai sitēja atbild par sišanu.
Jā Tēvs/Māte pretlikumīgi nolaupa bērnu (kas arvien vairāk notiek), tad vecāks, kas pretlikumīgi izved bērnu(s) no mītnes valsts -- atbild par savām rīcībām.
Individuāla atbildība ir ļoti svarīga -- lai atšķirtu agresorus no upuriem -- un lai neiekristu Latvijā populārā upuru vainošanā.

Līga Ance Līga, es nezinu, vai FBs spēj dot pieņemamu sapratni par izteikto. Esmu intensīvi pret vispārinājumiem, un nevainoju sieviešu dzimumu par itin neko...
Diemžēl, manā dzīvē nav parādījies, ka "karma" vai "bumerangs" vispāri darbojās -- šajsaulē. To ievēroju, kad man 90s gados nozaga ļoti vērtīgu izgudrojumu. Es paliku bez nekā, zagļi -- ar miljoniem.
Bumerangs -- nav.
Es izlēmu tomēr būt patiesam, tomēr būt labam -- pat ja "godalgu" nesaņemšu, un pat ja konsekvences "ļaunie" reti saņem.
Par siguldieti, esmu vairākus iesniegumus iesniedzis policijai, un šobrīd tur nekas neiet uz priekšu, bet vismaz esmu visu iesniedzis, jo šī sieviete ir tik viltīga, ka noteikti būtu varējusi nākt un centusies manu reputāciju nākotnē bojāt. To esmu daudzmas varējis apturēt, bet varbūt Tu enerģetiski jūti manas dvēseles vaidu/sāpes, ka vispāri Dieviņš atļāva tai siguldietei figurēt manas un manas meitiņās dzīvē.
Viens "labums" no piedzīvotā, ir ka cilvēki ir uzticējuši man savas ciešanas -- tagad pazīstu divus vīriešus, kuriem xSievas mēģināja viņus nogalināt -- pazīstu sievieti, kurai xVīrs -- nu -- ir ļoti ļoti ļauns cilvēks.
Varbūt biju naīvs, bet tiiiiiik ļaunus -- cilvēkus -- nu nezinu vai īsti par to visu gribēju zināt.
Un jā, būtu ļoti šajsaules spēkiem pateicīgs, ja šī siguldiete piedzīvotu bumerangu -- un joprojām vēlos manas mantas no viņas atpakaļ -- un burtiski nākamnedēļ man ir projektiņš kurā viens pie viņas palicis darba rīks man būtu vajadzīgs. Viņa man neļauj atnākt pēc savām mantām, kuras atstāju, jo viņa mani bija pārliecinājusi, ka esmu mājās un mīlēts.
Dažas mantiņas nav atvietojamas, jo tās mana mamma man uzdāvināja...laikam būs jābrauc pirkt darba rīkus otrreiz, bet viens ir Austrijā pirkts, un to neatrodu Latvijā.
Biju Austrijā un diemžēl emocionāli sabruku attiecīgajā veikalā -- jo kaut kādīgi joprojām nesaprotu, kā viens cilvēks varēja manā un manas meitas dzīvē izraisīt tik dziļu traumatizējumu.
Divus gadus meitiņa gāja terapijā.
Es vēl neesmu gatavs publiski par notikumiem runāt -- bet lūdzu neraizējies -- es nevainoju "visas" sievietes. Es to nekad nedarītu!





















Dear Modern Musician Family!

Hi, my name is Dainis W. Michel. I am feeling very shy about introducing myself here. I will share a bit of back-story after I share some links

This is a “score bookshelf” at my website
https://dainis.net/music/score-bookshelf/
though it is incomplete.

A nice pop song of mine is available here: https://open.spotify.com/track/5FdMr6pnCN3ZuZbkhRV4pC?si=1f2e921360ce475b

I recently entered a song competition with these two songs, and if you like them, pressing “like” would be very much appreciated. Last year, I won the “audience favorite” award (which was based on likes), so that was quite nice. 

https://fb.watch/sZahuvQf4z/

https://fb.watch/sZai4OxncQ/

A short comment like “wonderful!” or “skaisti” or “brīnišķīgi!” would be greatly appreciated!

I’ve written a few books, including one on songwriting: https://dainis.net/learn-how-to-write-your-songs-down

My students have done very very well, but I am scared that sharing that aspect of my life could be interpreted as some kind of self-marketing to the group — for which I could be reprimanded and my posts could be removed, etc. 

My back-story is that my xWife promised to “sell me,” and I promised to sell her (as a singer). I did my part, but she did not do hers. As a result, I have been able to win awards with my music, but I have basically sold nothing at all. Like nothing. Or almost completely nothing. 

I am a good teacher, but presenting myself as such, for example in FB groups, has met with severe severe backlash. 

I had done all of the coursework and just had my dissertation to write — and I would have a doctorate in Musikwissenschaft from the University of Vienna — but I spent 10 years as a FT single dad, after which my daughter was abducted. 

That kind stress kept me from completing my doctorate, which is why I am not currently a music composition professor…which was my life-plan. 

I teach privately and do stuff like this from time to time: 
https://www.tiktok.com/@dainisw.michel/video/7335666059145530657

https://www.tiktok.com/@dainisw.michel/video/7346977284416425248

https://www.tiktok.com/@dainisw.michel/video/7222371820383620378

I would say about 1million Latvians know me as a public personality and musician, and I gave a fairly successful concert last year on the 4th of July. 

I struggle deeply with the betrayal I’ve faced with regard to my xWife promising to “sell me,” regarding selling my compositions (sync placements, media, movies, commercials), because I knew/know that I am just so utterly terrible at “selling myself,” and I don’t exactly know how to turn the corner on that. 

Even though the “rules” of this server don’t appear before we introduce ourselves, I’m concerned that sharing the link to the book I’ve written about songwriting will be construed as “pitching” to the group. I haven’t even sold one copy of that eBook this year. The testimonials are real — I wrote a recommendation for one of my former students to get a teaching job this year — but “selling eBooks about songwriting” was something that happened naturally over 10 years ago. Now, it looks like the social media environment is pay to play — only — and people are just so incredibly cruel about anyone even trying to earn a living through anything other than paid ads. 

So, if I am going to be berated here for presenting myself, then I guess that’s what is going to happen. 

I am a very helpful person and am unfortunately in the position of having over over over over over “paid it forward,” with very little in return. 

I have a few “offers” I actually could make for the group, but at the moment, I am incredibly tired. I’ve regained contact with my daughter and after now 3 more years of ridiculous defending myself against the impossibly insane law in Austria that: if a mother says it, it is considered true and legally binding, and if a father claims something else is true, he has to prove it…I mean I just “won” in court, but my daughter is now 17. It’s been an incredibly fatiguing journey. 

Ideally, if I can figure out some way to use “street team,” and I can also shake off the sadness and fatigue that I feel, I could have a “Starter Kit” pre-sales page ready by Sunday, because on that day, I am participating in a family camp where I’ve sung almost every year for the last few years. Pre-abduction, my daughter and I are singing at that camp here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw6xfVZ2LO0

I have paid for 4 months already and have hesitated to start, in part because of my fear of being berated or reprimanded for just presenting myself as who I am — which includes being an author, solfeggio, composition, arranging and songwriting teacher. 

Maybe I will be welcomed at Modern Musician as I am…we’ll see.

Nu tā, izveidoju šo WhatsApp-a grupiņu nonākt pie skaidrības ar Pērles ļaudīm, un visticamāk daudzmaz atvadīties. 

Šajā grupiņā ir:

Dace
Dainis
Ģirts
Miks
Rasa
Rota

Vēlos pateikties, par skaistajiem brīžiem, kad biju aicināts…man ļoti patikās talkot un justies piederīgam. Bija itsevišķi skaisti pasniegt un izveidot jaunas dziesmas.

Iekopēšu šeit audio ierakstu, kuru ierakstīju šī gada maijā, un mazliet ieklausoties, ierakstā dalos ar pārkāpumiem, kuriem tieša sakara ar Pērlēm nav…bet nespēšu vēlreiz kko šādu ierakstīt…tātad atstāšu. 

(Ieraksts)

Vēlos arī pateikt: ja saņēmēji pirms rudens noklausīsies un atbildēs, pateikšos. Steigas nav. 

Kopš ieraksta, pēdīgi, Austrijas tiesā varēju saņemt patiesu lēmumu sakarā ar Emītes situāciju…bet arī sanāk tā, ka Pērles ļaudis gan nejuta situācijai līdzi, un izpalīdzīgu atbalstu nesniedza.

2022. g. vasarā sagatavoju dzejas, dziesmas, uzdevumus, ievingrināju eiritmiju…domādams, ka protams mūsu sadarbība turpināsies. Bet mani neņēma kā skolotāju. Man pateica es varot droši nākt ciemoties. Bet es taču negribēju tikai “ciemoties.” Es būtu daudz uzņēmies, lai būtu Pērlēs pasniedzēja/skolotāja lomā, lai izveidotu kvalitatīvu mācību programmu, lai visu finansētu, un lai mūsu sadarbība būtu savstarpēji atbalstoša un skaista. 

Jutos patiesi “saukts,” kad Jānis Vītols man pateica, ka viņš priecātos, ja mūsu kopēji izveidotās dziesmas tiktu ierakstītas, un 2023. gada martā, Rasa man piezvanīja un pateica, ka tās ierakstīsim pēc dziesmu svētkiem…ka mani lūgs uz Pērlēm, un to svēto darbiņu paveiksim…

Bet tas nenotikās un tagad vairāk nekā gadu, neesmu itin nekā no Pērlēm dzirdējis…izņemot Rotas lūgumu mājiņu pieskatīt…ar kuru es sāku pārdomāt manas pamata vērtības sakarā ar draugiem un kopienām un manu līdzdalību gan draudzībās gan kopienās. 

Es pieņemu, ka būtu varējis vienkārši ierasties. Dot no sevīm. Strādāt. Bet vai mums ir abpusēji atbalstoša un atgrezeniski labvēlīga sadarbība un izpalīdzīga iesaiste viens otra ikdienās?





Darvina teoriju pašu plaši pārprot, un “piemērotāko izdzīvošana" nav “stiprākā priekšroka.” Darvins pats uzsvēra draudzīgumu un sadarbību. 


patiesiskums ir pamata vērtība, kā arī atgrezeniski labvēlīga sadarbība un izpalīdzīga iesaiste viens otra ikdienā. 



Christine Decroix on Michael  (KLAVIERES!)

"As a friend, I spent a great amount of time in the recording studio with him, we always had children with us and were always laughing and playing between recording sessions. He brought a lot of joy in people lives. I grew up in Belgium raised by my dad who, as a chief of police, taught me to always be suspicious and I can tell you that I couldn’t see anything wrong with Michael, except maybe that it was a man who at a young age never had the time to be a kid. He told me once that children are pure and innocent and adults always want something from him. That’s the sole reason he felt more comfortable with children, they just loved him because he was magic for the kids and made them feel like giants. He loathed vulgarity and would have been upset at me laughing with a dirty joke in the studio.
He built a movie theatre for disabled children in his house. People are sick to think he did that to attract them as a child molester. They judge without knowing and should be ashamed because they largely contributed to his downfall and his death. Michael Jackson was hypersensitive, maybe it was the key of his huge talent. He suffered tremendously of all these false accusations and the slanders that were spread. These unscrupulous persons took everything away from him, including his amazing career.
He was a genius and an amazing talent already at a young age. Nobody can judge him without knowing him. If one of you had spent only one hour with him, you would have fallen in love with his pure heart. He could make everybody around him feel special. He was even thanking you for working with him, and had definitely not a big star attitude, he was down to earth, lived on a healthy diet, never drank alcohol. The day of my birthday party in Tokyo he took my glass of champagne away from me and replaced it by a glass of water. He was not joking he just cared for people.
I know today that his place belongs in Paradise.

You can purchase the board game directly with me (and not Amazon) by going to www.DisparityTrap.com. As a board game creator with a master's degree education in business and a passion for social justice, I've found myself having to file for bankruptcy because Jeff Bezos and Amazon have stolen over $100k from my small business—a business I started with my own money to create and manufacture educational and satisfying board games. Despite my efforts, including navigating Amazon's processes to reclaim my $17k in funds from my Amazon store account and reclaim over 2600 units of inventory (worth over $90k), I was met with basically a 'f*ck you' from Amazon, and have accumulated so much debt over these four months fighting this in the appeal process that I have to file for bankruptcy. So, I have no other choice but to share my story to warn others 



Skaistāk ir būt labsirdīgam un just sāpes, nekā būt cietsirdīgam un radīt ciešanas.

Skaistāk ir būt labsirdīgam un just sāpes, nekā būt cietsirdīgam un sāpināt.

Vai ir skaistāk būt labsirdīgam un izturēt sāpes, vai cietsirdīgam un sāpināt?

Ir skaistāk būt labsirdīgam un izciest sāpes, nekā būt cietsirdīgam un radīt ciešanas.




June 21st, 2015:
Not everyone you meet will give you the respect or love that you deserve. Respect them anyway. Love them anyway. No matter what you do, be kind. It is better to be kind and hurt, than unkind and cause pain. You were given the gift of gentleness and kindness. You were given the gift of a soft heart. So do not lose it. Do not allow your heart to harden. Just because someone caused you pain, it does not mean that everyone will. Just because someone betrayed your trust, it does not mean that others aren't trustworthy. Just because someone broke your heart, it does not mean that it will remain broken forever. It is better to love with a whole heart, to give with a whole heart, and to trust with a whole heart, than to never experience the beauty of love, the reward of giving, and the comfort of trusting. And when you fall hard, you can choose to remain on the ground for as long as you want, but you can also choose to get back up. Love again. Give again. Trust again. It is the experience that grows you, not the fear of it.

TRIGGER WARNING: reference to abuse.
Hi everyone, I've been sitting with this post for a while trying to find the right way to express myself. Let it be known that I'm trying to keep this post with as much of a sense of inquiry and openness as possible, whilst at the same time sitting in my place as an elder within my community who takes my responsibility to, and for ethical practice very very seriously indeed.
So much is coming to light right now about behaviour that is out of alignment in our spiritual communities. At the weekend, I was out with two dear friends and we were discussing "bystander apathy" (in a different context), the example given being where a bunch of people might be sitting in a room seeing smoke coming under the door, but because nobody else is shouting "fire" everyone else presumes things are ok...until they are not! 
This is what I see happening in our communities when people work without adhering to very strict and integral codes of ethics ('because it's spiritual and we don't need them"), and without truly walking in alignment with their personal and professional values. 
Too many things are slipping through the net because we are afraid to call them out. Whilst I don't agree with cancel culture, I do feel it's very important that people do the inner work to heal their own gaps in awareness(yes I see the irony of being able to do work on what is in principle a n invisible gap!) and take responsibility in humility when they/we deviate from 'the path'.
When concerns are named and shared, this is what I often hear within our communities:
"Well there's always two sides to a story"
"I don't do drama so I'm not going getting involved"
"It doesn't affect me and I've got enough on my plate anyway"
"If it's real they should go to the police" (yeah right because they are always a 'safe' option!!)
For me, referring back to the example about bystander apathy given above, there is often no smoke without fire or rather no fire without smoke showing itself first! 
No-one wants to see their friends called to account, that's hard right, but if they are really your friends, why are we not doing that in the first place, or why are we not asking those hard questions? 
If more than one person comes forward with concerns about another person's ethics or safety, I pay attention. I will then make choices about whether or not I attend those events, use those spaces, or communicate with others about what I'm hearing, and that's not always an easy decision to make. BUT if I sit and do nothing, knowing these things, I am surely part of the problem? I have been blocked by a male friend recently who did not like being called out about stuff (which I did in private FYI not to shame them) and yet in spite of the many attempts to do that compassionately before things got to that point, the person did not want to 'hear' it. 
The other thing I hear in our communities is that these things should be taken into circles to be discussed, without any recognition of the fact that the person making the allegation may feel completely unsafe being in another person's or people's company who has for example been the abuser or who has violated their boundaries in some way. This would be like asking a person fleeing domestic violence to sit with their abuser and chat because "you'll be safe" in circle. No! You may well not be! We have no obligation to 'fix' our abusers with a 'willingness to talk' until we feel ready, which may be never! You are not a bad person  or a coward for wanting to keep yourself safe! 
Having lived through many abusive situations, I can also see the parts in myself that remained unhealed that allowed me not to observe or pay attention to red flags, or where I simply did not know how to get out of those situations once in them. Many abusers are really charming and have lots of friends who think they are great but don't know or see what's going on in the background. 
I honestly feel that we are living in times where all of this stuff is now coming to the light and if we are to truly "Walk in Beauty" (a Navajo/Diné prayer) as a collective, we MUST not ignore, collude or threaten legal action within the same systems that create the problems!!!! 
How can we speak softly to these things but bring in a strong dose of tough love when it's required?
Many of us who speak out end up being the target of backlash and retaliation, so we need to strengthen our communities so that we have ways that we can address these issues, register concerns somehow and know that there is supportive place to help us navigate those kind of challenges.
Speaking out about injustice has been a huge part of my life's work, and sometimes I really wish I could turn a blind eye for an easy life but I can't, so I am always willing to bear the brunt of that if it means I can stand in my own integrity with it. I usually think "would my children be grateful I took this stand" (for the Seven Generations to come).
No more can we cover up, hide, keep silent, keep secrets, keep on perpetuating the sickness that comes from the pain of our own or other people's unintegrated trauma (which I do feel compassionately is at the root of much of the dark behaviour). No more can we allow those things to go unspoken or be fearful of being exiled from our communities. 
To those who deviate, most of us can genuinely feel the remorse of a person who knows that they did wrong and is committed to making amends. We need to do better! 
We need the Elders to show the way, model good practice and we need safe, strong, boundaried Elders to do that. 
May we find our way home to the light with every breath we take.
For All Our Relations

I studied this in psychology and it’s very disturbing. I feel like people are NPC’s or think they are watching TV or playing a video game.
I know too many who even claim they are awake get paralyzed by fear.
I always run towards the danger to help… at my own expense. But only if it’s serious.
I have a depression to some degree about this for those that don’t come to my rescue when I need it. Especially disappointed in men.
Sigh.
I guess I was triggered before watching the video because everyone is so cowardly these days



Ir labāk būt labestīgam un sāpinātam, nekā cietsirdīgam un sāpināt. 

Sveiks!

Nu ja, redzot socmedijos reklāmas sludinot Trejdeviņu saeitu, domāju, ka ir pienācis laiks noskaidrot Mežasalas Roberta rīcības pret manīm un kamdēļ no Trejdeviņu ļaudīm neiesaistījās konfliktu labvēlīgi atrisināt. 

2021. gada vasarā tiku aicināts muzicēt, un to darīju…palīdzēju saietai atsvabināties no policijas nelabvēlīgo ierobežojumu uzspiešanas, un patiešām jutu, ka biju atradis grupu ar “savējiem.”

Tā arī socmedijos sludina: pavadīt laiku ar savējiem. 

Bet sanāk tā, ka man patiesiskums ir pamata vērtība, kā arī atgrezeniski labvēlīga sadarbība un izpalīdzīga iesaiste viens otra ikdienā. 

Es 2021/2022 gaidīju no Trejdeviņu saietas vadības atbildi vai es vadītu “Raksti savu dziesmu” nodarbību saietas laikā, vai ne. To nodarbību esmu vadījis kā dažu stundu grupas nodarbību (piem “Mainām pasauli” festivālā), privātstundās personīgi vai onlainā, vai arī kā “ievirzi” nedēļas garumā 3x3 ģimenes saietā. Pamatā ir šis teksts: https://dainis.net/learn-how-to-write-your-songs-down un rezultāti patiešām ir bijuši ļoti skaisti cilvēkiem visos vecumos — no bērniem līdz senioriem. 

Diemžēl, man 2022. gadā nenāca un nenāca atbildes no Trejdeviņu vadības — un man arī bija piedāvājums citā nometnē atalgoti ar bērniem muzicēt — bet jo esmu medicīnisko cilvēktiesību aizstāvis — sirds vilka palikt pie “savējiem” Trejdeviņos…

Bet ierodoties Trejdeviņu nometnē, iekārtojos mītnē, atvēru datoru, un Roberts man bija atsūtījis patiešām absurdi ļaunsirdīgu epastu, un nekas nebija skaidrs: vai es muzicēšu jā vai nē, jo ar muzicēšanu man būtu jāmaksā puscena (vai arī nebūtu jāmaksā), vai es pasniedzu jā vai nē…un vai man vispāri palikt saietā ar tik ļaunsirdīgu komunikāciju ar Robertu? 

Es šo neesmu līdz šim atklājis, bet es līdz pēdējai dienai pirms saietas 2022. gadā cīnījos, lai mana meita varētu atlidot uz Latviju un piedalīties. Lai gan biju atguvis kontaktu ar meitiņu, viņu turēja valstī, kas neievēro Hāgas konvenciju par starptautisko bērnu nolaupīšanu, un Roberts man pārmeta, ka es neesot “savējais,” jo nedevu skaidru ziņu, vai mana meita varēs piedalīties. Tik neiejūtīgu uzvedību pret manīm esmu tikai reti piedzīvojis. 

Es tad noskaidroju, nu laikam nepasniedzu. Laikam negrib, ka es novadītu dienas rīta dziesmu, pieskaņotu dienas tēmai…nu labi…izgudroju piedalīties tieši Roberta pasniegtās nodarbībās, lai varbūt konfliktu atrisinātu…bet ne tikai, ka neieintresējās par legālo situāciju sakarā ar manu meitu, Roberts pateica, ka “tas ko Tu dari” ar tautisko mūziku esot: “mūsu tautas puvums.”

Ar tādu apsaukāšanu, devos piedalīties Dziesma Dejo Deja Skan pasākumā, un nepaliku uz visu nedēļu Trejdeviņos. 

Es vairākus mēnešus tā īsti nevarēju vairs rakstīt tautiskus darbus. Roberts bija par mani melojis, sagrieza datumus, neiejutās situācijā ar manu meitu, un nosauca šāda veida mūziku:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T11F6B7NaTM

un tās veicināšanu jauniešos - kreatīvu izpausmi - par “mūsu tautas puvumu.”

Pacentos to ar JuriR/MāriČ tematizēt, bet kaut kādīgi post-padomju neiesaiste citu cilvēku “problēmās,” ņēma priekšroku, un Roberta manis apsaukāšana palika spēkā. 

2023. gadā netiku aicināts…un arī neesmu kādu gadiņu ticis aicināts pie JuraR, piem patalkot masku muzejā…

Nu ja. No Roberta emocionālās vardabības varēju katu cik atkopties, un šis būs mans šī gada gada darbs: 

https://www.tiktok.com/@dainisw.michel/video/7380845499840072993?lang=en

Tas būs korim, bet nu, “savējie” viens otram palīdz. Savējie iestātos par patiesiskumu un savstarpēju labvēlību, un tas manā gadījumā, nenotikās. 

Es neteiktu, ka esmu vārgs sakarā ar emocionālo varmācību, bet nu, Roberts dabūja gatavu ne tikai, ka par mani melo (kaut kāds ārprāts sakarā ar samaksu), ka kaut kādīgi mana cīņa līdz pēdējai dienai, lai mana meita varētu uz Latviju atlidot — bija uzvedība kas nebija piemērota “savējiem,” jo “nedevu laicīgi ziņu,” vai mana meita piedalīsies vai ne, bet nu — sanāca tā, ka neviens no Trejdeviņu darba grupas neiesaistījās dziedinošā, pretīmnākošā, iejūtīgā, saprotošā veidā — un tāda veida iesaiste ir daļa no manām pamata vērtībām. Draugs neatstāj draugu novārtā. 

Par to, patiešām ir nācis skumt, jo iejusties Latvijas sabiedrībā, kā 3. trimdas paaudzes latvietis — ar meitiņu, kas ir 4. trimdas paaudze — kas dzied, runā, raksta un lasa latviešu valodā — nu, bijušai trimdai nav viegli Latvijā — un tas būs (manuprāt) pārsvarā jo padomju propoganda ir ņēmusi sabiedrisko priekšroku. 

Par to labprāt parunātos, bet nu: nodošana, izsūtīšana, izraidīšana, apmelošana, “stučīšana,” tās var uztvert par post-padomju latviešu īpašībām, no kurām bijušā trimdā izteikti centās izvairīties. Bet, sanāk tā, ka es no vairākiem tūkstošiem maniem vienaudžiem — esmu vienīgais bijušais trimdinieks, kas Latvijā dzīvo. Daudzi ir mēģinājuši atvākties un iejusties, bet šāda veida cietsirdība ir viens no visbiežāk minētiem iemesliem, kamdēļ bijušie trimdinieki patstāvīgu dzīvi Latvijā reti iztur. 

Ir nācies dziļi skumt, jo Roberta uzvedību pret manīm var uzskatīt kā simbolisku mūsu tautas graušanu - laikam tās uzturēšanas “vārdā.” Atbalstīt bērniņu un pieagušo kreatīvitāti sakarā ar piederību latviešu kultūrai — Trejdeviņu ļaudis to patiešām uzskata par “mūsu tautas puvumu?” 

Roberta vārdi ir man pat uz skatuves ienākuši prātā un man tad ir viņa ļaunsirdība jānokrata — bet tas notiek arvien retāk. Roberts man pēc 2022. g. saietas skarbi atrakstīja: “samaksā un pēc tam es ar Tevi runāšu!” umm, ok, Robert, es katru reizi summai pieliku mazlietiņ klāt — un vēl pēc nometnes, man pa visu nedēļu tad lika maksāt, lai gan apsaukāts 2022. gadā tikai paliku 3 dienas. Sanāk arī tā, ka pēc tam, ka paaugstināto summu samaksāju, Roberts ar mani neizrunājās. 

Nerunājam arī par to, ka es visus savus Eiropas kontus biju likvidējis, dēļ kovidsodiem, kurus līdz šai dienai neesmu maksājis, un netaisos maksāt. Bet par to runātos — ja būtu patiesa un savstarpēji labvēlīga gaisotne. Tātad pārskaitījumu saietai veica dziedinošās eiritmijas skolotāja Jūlija Jansone, kurai bija iemakstāts, par to ka viņai asistēju. Tātad arī tādas saprotamas komplikācijas, kuras var ar skaidru labvēlīgu izrunāšanos viegli nokārtot, netika labvēlīgi nokārtotas. 

Un nu, kā mēdz ar mani būt, notikumiem un sarunām līdzi “virmojās” zinātnieciski pierādīti pamati. Šajā notikumā, tas, ka Darvina teoriju pašu plaši pārprot, un “piemērotāko izdzīvošana" nav “stiprākā priekšroka.” Darvins pats uzsvēra draudzīgumu un sadarbību. Tātad, jo nepiedzīvoju draudzīgu un izpalīdzīgu iesaisti, konfliktu atrisināt, un vienkārši normāli lietas izrunāt — sanāk indikācija, ka latviešu tauta, iespējams nepaspēs izdzīvot.

Ja Roberta uzvedība būtu izņēmums, tas būtu pārspīlējums — bet tagad esmu Latvijā atkārtoti piedzīvojis, ka sabiedrība vai kopiena vienkārši pakļaujās tam, kas visļaunāk un visskaļāk bļauj, vai tam kas vismanipulatīvāk un ļaunsirdīgāk rīkojās.  

Nav man neviens no Trejdeviņu ļaudīm, uzzinājis kā man un manai meitiņai iet, bet vēl pateikšu, ka Emīte ir tagad 2 gadus izgājusi terapijai cauri, un pats esmu ņēmis vairākas terapijas vērā, lai tiktu galā ar traumatizējošiem piedzīvojumiem 2021-2024. 

Lai gan Latvijas policija nepalīdzēja — Austrijas policija palīdzēja, un tagad Austrijas tiesā ir bijis patiess un dziedinošs lēmums (paldies Dievam). 

Es joprojām būtu pateicīgs, ja patiesi iesaistītos, draudzības un sadarbības gaisotnē. 

Sirsnībā, 
Dainis W. Michelis

Liebe Maria und Hermann,

Sie werden es schon geahnt haben. Ich habe einfach alles gegeben, nach Emis Entführung, um die Obsorge der Emilija wiederaufrecht gestellt zu bekommen. Es war ein absurdes Prozess und am 11. juni wurde der Entzug der Obsorge entkraftet. 

Meine xFrau schuldet mir Kindergeld seit 2013 (wenn Sie wollen, schicke ich gerne Unterlagen), und der Ausmaß an Betrug und “Wahnsinn” den ich durchstehen musste — ist einfach absurd. 

Hermann scheint informiert zu sein, wie absurd die Familienrechtssituation in Österreich derzeit noch ist…und es wird nicht überraschen, dass Österreich sogar den Hager Übereinkommen über Elternliche Kindesobsorge — ignoriert. Danke, Österreich. 

Damit es klar ist, 2011-2021, habe ich Emi ganz alleine erzogen, aber 2. April 2021, hat meine xGattin Emi von Lettland nach Österreich entführt. Es ist ein sehr klarer Fall — absolut gegen unserer Elternvereinbarung. 

In Folge ist Emi 2x in der Schule durchgefallen, und bis 13/14. Juni hat Emi noch Aufgaben bei ihrer Onlineschule abgegeben. 

Wir warten noch auf den Berichten von den staatlichen Prüfungen, aber es schaut so aus als ob, mit meiner Hilfe/Nachhilfe, hat Emi die 9. Klasse jetzt geschafft!

Leider, konnte ich mit diesen zwei Faktoren, mich nicht auf den Verdiensten konzentrieren, und die einzige Arbeit die ich derzeit habe, ist auf KommissionsBasis diese Klaviere zu vermitteln: 

https://klavins-pianos.com/products/model-450i/

So toll meine Website vielleicht ausschaut, https://dainis.net/, und meine Reihe an:
 
Büchern
Beispiel: https://dainis.net/learn-how-to-write-your-songs-down

Musik
Beispiel: https://open.spotify.com/track/5FdMr6pnCN3ZuZbkhRV4pC?si=5a4a9fd736cf4e48

Erfindungen
Beispiel: https://www.variowipes.com

und Software
Beispiel: https://www.lesaep.com

die gemacht oder konzipiert habe — ausschauen — habe ich seit der Alleinerziehung ab 2011, und nach Emis Entführung insbesonders (ab 2021), mir sehr schwer getan beim verdienen. 

Habe immer wieder sehr gut bezahlte stellen bekommen, aber wurde immer wieder mit mir unterträglicher Korruption konfrontiert…

Ich war in Lettland sehr sichtbar als medizinischer Menschenrechtler, der es strengst verteidigt hat, dass jeder das Menschenrecht hat, über seinen Körper, und über die eigene minderjährigen Kinder, die medizinischen Entscheidungen privat und selber, zu machen. 

Leider, führte dies dazu dass ich von “Vielleichtpolizisten” in Lettland schwerst verprügelt wurde, und eigendlich habe ich noch immer Schmerzen die noch auszuheilen sind. 

Lange Rede, kurzer Sinn: ich kann die Miete heute nicht zahlen. 

Wenn Sie Kontakte haben, die unseren wunderbaren Klavier in einer Kirche oder Halle integrieren wollen würden — ja dann wäre dass ja ein unglaublicher Wunder -- bitte geben Sie mir bescheid…

Wenn jetzt Hermann sich bemüht und ihr privat die derzeitigen Renovierungen machen — also ich könnte ja auch mithelfen. 

Aber sonst, sitze ich und schreibe kirchliche Leitungung an — Ministerien von Künsten in diversen Ländern — und suche Käufer für unsere Klaviere. 

Seit Emis Entführung, irgendwie, wurde ich sehr oft bei meinen Bewerbungen abgelehnt…

Jetzt, dass die Obsorge wieder hergestellt wurde, irgendwie fühle ich mich viel besser — vielleicht wird dass auch etwas in mir verändern — damit meine Bewerbungen endlich wieder Erfolg bringen!

Ich habe bis ich Blau im Gesicht war, dem lieben Gott gebeten, dass dieser junge Mann: https://www.tiktok.com/@___isaiah/video/7371448505207934250 unsere Klaviere vermitteln würde…so viele “Herzilein,” aber noch kein Käufer…

Ich wäre euch Beiden sehr sehr sehr dankbar, wenn jetzt Sie keinen riesen Drama machen würden. Wenn alles so bleibt wie jetzt - werde ich sogar juli/august noch nicht zahlen können, aber die Hälfte werde ich September zahlen können, und die zweite Hälfte, Oktober. 

Sie müssen keinen Zuschlag verlangen, ich werde mehr zahlen als ich schulde. 

Die 65/pro Tag im Dezember — da jetzt ein Mietausfall kam — also die Erhöhung hat schon etwas geschmerzt — 15 mehr pro Tag fur den Monat ist viel -- aber ich würde es akzeptieren, dass ich schon am 1. Dez. die volle Summe bezahlen muss — oder wir verlieren die Reservation — irgendetwas auf dieser Art. 

Mir wird oft empfohlen endlich meine Musik am Markt zu bringen — aber diese Aufgabe hat meine xFrau vor der Ehe, versprochen, dass sie es macht — und irgendwie, habe ich mich nicht erholen können. Die letzten 10 Jahre insbesondere — habe ich grosse Einkommensschwankungen gehabt. Es bedrückt eigentlich sehr, weil ich schon ein sehr tüchtiger und zuverlässiger Typ bin…

Ginge es so: kein Drama — wir fliegen am 29. juni ab, ich konzentriere ich an meinen Verdienstmöglichkeiten (auch Jobsuche, Unternehmensentwicklung), und Sie bekommen zwei Zahlungen vor der 2. Oktober Woche?

Diese ganze Sache schmerzt sehr, weil ich ja nur meine Dissertation fertig schreiben musste — und ich wäre Prof. der Musikwissenschaft geworden — statt die Dissertation zu schreiben — habe ich 10 Kilo (keine Übertreibung) Gerichtsprozesse, nur weil ich als Mann meine Tochter erzogen habe — und weil meine xFrau stängid irgenein Betrug machte…

Also, verzeihen Sie bitte mir mein Küchendeutsch, und: 

Voller offener Betrag gedeckt plus Zuschlag bis 2. Oktober Woche

Volle Zahlung für Dez 7 bis Januar 7 (Wohnung 2) überwiesen bis 1. Dezember? 

Würde dass so passen?

Es würde ihnen ja auch zustehen uns rauszuwerfen vor den 29. juni. Ich weiss nicht wass ich mit so einer Absicht machen würde, da unsere Flugkarten am 29. sind, und Geld habe ich genug für das Essen aber nicht für die Miete. 

Können Sie Geduld haben und mir auch Erfolg wünschen? Ich habe einfach diese Lebensschläge wohlverdienend nicht durchstehen können. 

Pläne haben wir noch nicht festgemacht für August-Oktober…

Herzlichst und hochachtungsvoll, 
Dainis W. Michel (Emis Papa)








aaah -- mēs tur feinas jaungada svinības nosvinējām -- spēlējām ASV futbolu sniegā!

vasarās gan biju GVV...kur mana mamma ilgus gadus bija direktore

labi...saprotu...un es lūgšu sapratni par informāciju, ar kuru dalījos...vienkārši mana dzīve pirms 3 gadiem -- ar specifiskiem notikumiem Jāņu nedēļā -- radikāli mainījās. neesam vēl atkopušies, jo traumatizējumi ir bijuši visai dziļi. 

paliek arī tāds kā, nu angliski saka "flailing," nu tāda kā bezcerīga vicināšanās pēc skaidrojumiem kamdēļ "tie cilvēki kas atsakās ar mani komunicēt" rīkojās tik ļaunsirdīgi un ievainojoši. 

…vai viņu rīcības bija tīšas? it kā mazlietiņ cerēju uz “to laimi,” ka kaut kādīgi rakstot Tev, nāktu tuvāk pie skaidrības. 

tos cilvēkus atceros baltos kreklos un tautas tērpos -- bet iedarbība manā ģimenītē (meitiņa, Omīte, un es), bija patiešām izteikti postoša -- un tik spēcīgi postoša, ka sastopos ar nesapratni: kā vispāri tā varēja, kā to var "tā" atstāt? 

Lai būtu skaidrs: Ar meitiņu bijām Rāmi Riti vadītājas "Dainu meditācijā" 2021. feb. No feb-augusta 2021, bija ļoti cieša līdzdalība tajā “sabiedrībā.”

Manu meitiņu laupīja ar vienas Ineses Kozuliņas draudzenes (tīšu vai nejaušu, bet tiešu) palīdzību 2021. g. 2. aprīlī. 

Tad Emīte zaudēja apm 6 mēnešus -- gandrīz gadu -- un saka, ka bija "kaut kādā miglā." 

Ar Austrijas policijas palīdzību, varēju atgūt kontaktu ar meitiņu, kura dzīvojās smirdīgā viņas mātes dzīvoklī starp viņas mātes guļamistabu un tualetes -- bez gultas. 

Es tad to dzīvokli satīrīju un sākām censties saprast kas vispāri notikās. Kad sāku prasīt jautājumus šiem “Dainu meditācijas” cilvēkiem, mani nobloķēja — atteicās atbildēt uz maniem konkrētiem un būtiskiem jautājumiem — un sāka par mani aiz manas muguras izplatīt patiešām ļoti melnus melus. 

Spontāni, ne visai apdomāti, aizrakstīju Tev arī ar kaut kādu dullu iekšējo cerību pēdīgi saņemt kaut kādas atbildes…


Paga…atsūtīšu dažas bildes…

















Greetings and Praise be to God,

In deep prayer, I received the answer that "Piano Chapels" can bring people closer to God. Too many people aren't just straying from the Lord's path, but their behavior is cruel. How can we facilitate peace and harmony on Earth, despite the current worldwide whirlwind of lies, deception, violence, and even threats of world war?

“Build piano chapels.” Those are the three words that came to me while praying at St. Stephen’s Cathedral in Vienna, Austria, on June 11th, 2024. 

We have thousands of organs around the world — and while the finest organs with the finest organists provide musical experiences that connect us with the heavenly realms, making beautiful adjustments in timbre and rhythm — pushing and pulling stops --- it's all the more common that a simple electronic keyboard is used, and the organs aren't even played.

What kind of new musical experience can bring more people to worship, and what kind of instrument can create sounds so powerful, so rich, and so heavenly, that listeners will be moved to transform their sin into righteous living?

David Klavins, a dear friend in Faith and master craftsman, builds the world's largest vertical concert grand pianos. His masterpiece:

https://klavins-pianos.com/products/model-450i/

could replace the organ in a "Piano Chapel," in German: “eine Klavierkapelle."

The piano-forte instrument can provide subtle quiet, piano sounds, and thunder with powerfully loud forte sounds — which is something that a pipe organ just cannot do.

David will be turning 70 years old this year, and he thinks he can only build about 10 more of these instruments, so the time to act is now. He is the only person in the world who can craft these incredible instruments, and prayer clearly commanded me to get in touch with you — and to seek chapels where we can build such powerful testaments to the divine sonic and resonant glory of God.

Imagine the musical power and presence of a pipe organ — but it's a piano — that can play not only rich bass notes and thunderous soul-stirring fortissimos, but it can also deliver soft pianissimos and delicate, crystal clear, almost magical and angelic bell-like high tones — and the maintenance and tuning can simply be handled by well-trained piano professionals (quite easy to find in comparison to technicians who can renovate and maintain large pipe-organs).

I was guided in prayer to get in touch with your church leadership to discuss the potential of building such a Piano Chapel for your worship services. My prayer instructed me to mention that both secular and worship music could be performed with our large instrument, in a setting that would appeal to those who have not yet found their way to God. The musical experiences then, and the Chapel setting, can be architecturally designed to engage, transform, convert, and inspire listeners and performers alike.

The sounds our instruments make are truly heavenly, and we are eager to discuss with you, how we can share the joyful and powerful resonances of Heaven on Earth that our giant vertical concert grand pianos provide, in a “Piano Chapel,” built for your Church and congregation of believers.

I was also guided in prayer to mention that we are open to discussing various financing options, including gathering collections and donations, to realize this vision in a chapel and location of your choice.

Please feel free to contact me to explore this divinely-inspired opportunity further. 

Thank you for reviewing this proposal, and please forward my message to those in your organizational hierarchy, who can consider it, and potentially bring it to life. 

With respectful blessings,

Hello and Praise God, 

In deep prayer, I received the answer that "Piano Chapels" can bring people closer to God. Too many people aren’t just straying from the Lord’s path, but their behavior is cruel. How can we facilitate peace and harmony on Earth, despite the current worldwide whirlwind of lies, deception, violence, and even threats of world war?

Build piano chapels. 

We have thousands of organs around the world — and while the finest organs with the finest organists provide musical experiences that connect us with the heavenly realms, making beautiful adjustments in tembre and rhythm — pushing and pulling stops --- it’s all the more common that a simple electronic keyboard is used, and the organs aren’t even played. 

What kind of new musical experience can bring more people to worhip, and what kind of instrument can create sounds so powerful, so rich, and so heavenly, that listeners will be moved to transform their sin into righteous living?

My friend in faith, Davids Klavins, builds the world’s largest vertical concert grand pianos — and this model:

https://klavins-pianos.com/products/model-450i/

could become the “organ” in a “Piano Chapel,” in German: eine “Klavierkapelle.”

The piano-forte instrument can provide sublte quiet, piano sounds, and thunder with powerfully loud forte sounds — which is something that a pipe organ just cannot do. 

Davids will be turning 70 years old this year, and he thinks he can build about 10 more of these instruments. He is the only person in the world who can craft these incredible instruments, and prayer clearly commanded me to get in touch with you — and to seek chapels where we can build such a powerful testament to the divine sonic and resonant glory of God.

The sounds our instruments make are truly heavenly, and we would very much like to discuss with you, how we can provide the resonances of Heaven on Earth, in a Piano Chapel, built for your congregation of believers. 

I was also guided to mention that collections could be gathered in order to finance the build of one or more of these magnificent instruments in a Chapel and location of your choice.

Would you like to collaborate?






I effortlessly connect with the right clients who are excited to purchase the Klavins Model 450i piano.

"My confidence and passion for the Klavins pianos resonate with potential buyers, leading to immediate sales today.”

"Selling three Klavins Model 450i Vertical Concert Grand pianos this week is easy and natural for me, and I achieve it with grace and ease."


Es bez pūlēm kontaktējos ar klientiem, kuri sajūsmā šodien apstiprina, ka vēlas pirkt Klavins Model 450i klavieres

" I always have everything I need,

in my opinion, it is an immature power conflict. i also wish we did not reward predation the way we do, because collaboration is superior -- but harm and violence (and the capacity to get away with violence) trump peace every time (it is easier to break a window than to make one).

Edvīns P. Rasiņš tātad neesi ar mieru ar fizisku cīņu aizstāvēt Tavus ļaunsirdīgos pārmetumus. Es, Edvīn, biju ļoti slims, un jā -- dēļ urīnterapijas man vairs alerģiju nav, un man nebija jāiet uz aknu operāciju -- burtiski man nebija jāizoperē aknas.
Es to darīju 8 mēnešu ļoti tuvā pieskatē vienā Austrijas vēža klinikā.
Pēc tam, man galvenais ārsts teica: tik tīras asinis nemūžam neesmu redzējis.
Tu esi ļaunsirdīgs aprunātājs, un pat neesi ar mieru ne fiziski, ne intelektuāli aizstāvēt savu viedokli. Tu esi lūzeris un Tev būtu jāsāk spēt kritiski, loģiski, un empātiski domāt un komunicēt.
Es ticu, ka Tu to spētu, bet Tu vari iesākt ar to, ke neaprunā cilvēkus, kurus nepazīsti, un nesmejies par efektīgām terapijām, kurus tu nesaproti.





How to attract love? 3 techniques you should know
I am going to share with you 3 techniques worth trying to open yourself up to love.
I use these techniques in my new course entitled "OPEN TO LOVE"
1. Let go.
Let go of all the relationships that ever were.
Forgive and be thankful for all the relationships you've had.
Make a list of the things you are grateful for that person.
Really take a few minutes, and instead of focusing on what was bad, toxic about that relationship, focus on what you learned.
How has your life and your perception of the world changed?
What traits did you develop in this relationship / what did you learn?
What can you thank this particular person for?
Focusing on what was right and forgiving what was wrong. You free yourself from old patterns that you can repeat unconsciously and thus open yourself to something new.
2. Love yourself.
Your sense of worth and knowing that you deserve a wonderful relationship is the foundation of everything.
If you believe that you are worthless/deserving of no one, unfortunately that will be your reality.
If you don't respect yourself, don't have standards, and don't know your own values, the relationships you find yourself in will reflect that. People feel your energy.
3. New standards: we create a relationship
A very important step is to create a new one.
We create a new vision of who we want in our reality.
You can write a letter with the characteristics you want this person to have.
I would recommend that you write down how you want to feel about this person. He wrote how this person must feel about you. This step is based on the emotions you would feel having this relationship.
By creating this letter, answer me questions like?
- How do you want to feel with this person?
- How do you want that person to feel about you?
- you can put the appearance of the person (if it is important to you - you can put that the person is tall, thin, muscular, etc.)
- What do you do in your free time?
- Where do you go on dates?
- Does this person live in the same city?
- What is your contact with this person's friends?
- What is your contact with the family of this person?
- Do you have common passions?
This step is to let your imagination fly, write how you want to feel.
A very important step is to let go.
Hide this list and try to forget about it.
Let it manifest. Letting go of the magic and letting the magic work.





Emīte kaut ko dara maskā
ēnu teātris
aukstais kaŗš viz māksla
pēdējā trešdaļa ķīmija


I've started writing a childrens' story about a friendly fawn named Freddy. Growing up to be a sprightly buck, he was convinced that all we need -- is love. He loved eating sprouting spring flowers and convinced all of the birds to come home to unconditional love -- to all!

All of the birds chirped and cheered whenever they say Freddy prance by!

Then Freddy went to the riverside to spread the message of unconditional love to more animals. A really really really big crocodile came to the river bank, and listened intently as Freddy explained to him the benefits of opening your heart to reciprocal love and blissful joy. Freddy showed the crocodile a breathing exercise and the crocodile practiced breathing in all sadness, converting it to love in his heart, and exhaling gladness. 

The crocodile told Freddy how amazing the breathing exercises were and how light he felt in his soul -- Freddy said: wow, I can come with some of my friends tomorrow -- and you can bring your friends -- and we can all breathe together and bask in the joy of universal unconditional love. 

The crocodile said: "I thought you'd never ask."

That night, Freddy had vivid dreams of his message of unconditional love spreading all around the world, to all of the animals -- even to humans. 

With birds chirping and cheering, Freddy went with 10 of his friends to the riverside, and lo and behold, the crocodile had also brought 10 friends. 

The crocodiles asked Freddy and his friends to lean in close close to their noses, to see if they were breathing together, correctly. 

And then all 11 crocodiles simultaneously ate Freddy and all of his friends for lunch. 

The end.

Vienīgais veids, kā uzvarēt spēli, pret toksiskajiem cilvēkiem, ir nespēlēt vispāri. 





“Tu kaut kā to visu ļooooti sarežģī.”
Es to nedaru


“Vari to uztvert kā "cutting off narcisists' supply””
Tas būtu ļoti skaisti, bet Tev acīmredzot trūkst dažas kritiskas detaļas. 

“Par mantām, nu ja nevari konkrētā sarunā vai ar iestāžu palīdzību atgūt, tad arī tās var būt zudušas.”
Tas ir nepieņemami. Un Tava nostāja ir viens no punktiem, kas liek man šo piedzīvojumu izjust, kā pareģojumu, ka mūsu latviešu tauta nespēs pastāvēt. 

Ja šādi atļauj “attiecībām” izpausties sabiedrībā — tad mūsu tautai mugurkaula nav. Patiešām Tev trūkst dažas kritiskas detaļas.  


“Viss, kas jūsu starpā bija reāls, ir beidzies, cauri, finito vai ne? - un tagad tā ir tikai tāda dzīvošana pagātnē, apmēram kā virtuālajā realitātē.” 
Ar šādu cilvēku, kas tā spēj apieties ar citu dzīvu būtni, nav jēdzīgi uzturēt ne draudzību, ne sociālu saikni, ne “attiecības,” arī no pirmā brīža, kad likās, ahh, attiecības ies uz beigām…es taču iedomājos talku pie viņas, kurā izremontēt viņai otro stāvu…un visiem draugiem pateiktu, ka labvēlīgi izvēlējāmies romantiskās attiecības noslēgt. Bija man arī citi priekšlikumi, no viņai biju uzsvēris, cik man ir svarīgi, ka jaunās draudzības, mūzikālās iespējas, biznesa kontakti — satiktas vai nu ar vai cauri viņu — man ir ļoti nozīmīgas. Tas ka attiecības noslēgtu abpusēji cieņpilnā veidā, ja attiecības noslēgtu, bija mans absolūtais atkārtotais nosacījums vispāri iedziļināties attiecībās. 

Viņa tad ņēma un darīja tieši uz mata pretējo.  

Šīs sievietes uzvedība ir ietekmējusi gan manu, gan manas meitas, gan manas mammas ikdienu — turpina ietekmēt arī vasaras plānus. Tev trūkst dažas detaļas, un es ar tām neesmu dalījies. 




“Nav skaidrs, kāpēc gribi to sev nodarīt: tas ir apmēram kā anekdotē par Jāni, kurš sēž uz naglas, bet nost nekāps, labāk tūlīt pieradīs.”
Tā vienkārši nav. 

Viņa nav izskaidrojusi savas rīcības 
2021. g. 1-2. aprīlī
2021. g, 16.  aprīlī

nav atbildējusi par bērniņu
un nav atdevusi manas mantas. 

Kritiskās detaļas, Arti, ir nopietnas diezgan…turpināt…un patiešām esmu šokēts, ka Latvijas šajā mazā latviešu sabiedrības mikrokosmā nebija vajadzība pēc savstarpējās aizsardzības, nebija vēlme pēc patiesiskuma, un nebija vēlme pēc labvēlības. 

Arti, 2021. g. 1-2. aprīlī, šie sieviete kļuva par kritisko cilvēku ļoti nopietnā kriminālrīcībā — un man nav skaids, vai viņa to izdarīja tīšām vai ne. Šī nezināšana liek man, manai mammai, un manai meitai burtiski katru dienu justies apdraudētiem — un man pat ir zvanīts un teikts, ka mana meita nevienā pasaules valsīt nav drošībā. 

Tu kļūdies, ja Tu domā, ka šeit iet runa par kaut kādu “romantiku,” te iet runa par nopietnām kriminālrīcībām…kuras vienkārši cenšās noslāpēt. 

“Kāpēc domā, ka citiem nav bijusi darīšana ar nodevīgām, toksiskām vai vienkārši pusjukušām sievietēm un ar "dīvainām enerģijām”?”
Kāpēc Tu ieprojecē manī aplamu domu? Es joprojām ceru, ka būs starp latviešiem Latvijā cilvēki iejūtīgi diezgan, kas spēj saredzēt, ko šīs sievietes uzvedība patiešām izraisa mūsu sabiedrībā, ko tas nozīmē nākotnei — un ka šāda veida cilvēki (vienalga vai vīrieši vai sievietes), ir jātur pie atbildības — sabiedriski. 

“Vienkārši palaid” nav pieņemama rīcība. 

“you dodged the bullet.”
Tā ir taisnība, bet es tagad vēlos izvairīties no turpmākiem šāvieniem — tamdēļ sniedzos pēc paīdzības — un cilvēki var palīdzēt tikai ar stāju: jā, Tev vajadzētu drīkstēt savākt savas mantas, Daini, protams…un tie, kas zin par notikumiem 2021. g. 1-2. aprīlī — nu tur ir jābūt ļoti ļaunam secināt, ka problēma ir manī, un ka man dažas jā/nē atbildes nepienāktos. 

Mana meita nopietni cieta. 

“Iedomājies, ka jums būtu kopīgs bērns,”
Visticamāk es to bērniņu audzinātu, jo lai gan viņa man uzpūta greznu “future faking” par bērniņu un adoptētiem bērniem un kuplu ģimeni, laikam viņa nebūtu gribējusi bērniņu audzināt. Es to labprāt būtu darījis, jo taču jau savu meitiņu audzināju viens, jo mana xSieva atteicās vispāri mūsu meitiņu audzināt. Vai 1ned-1ned, protams visu būtu maksājis la la la, jau Austrijā rinda ar vīriešiem pilnlaiku audzina savus bērnus un maksā sievietēm krāpniecēm, kas dzīvo naktsdzīves uz vīra rēķina. 


Taču Tu labi zini, ka latviešiem patīk nejaukties nesavās darīšanās, toties latviešu sabiedrībai patīk vārds "normāli", un tas kā Tu šobrīd reaģē ir "oriģināli". 
Arti, es uzaugu bijušā trimdā — absolūti visu veltījām lai Latvija atgūtu savu neatkarību. Bijušās trimdas sabiedrība bija saliedēta un savstarpēji atbalstoša. Tas, ka jelkādā “draugu lokā,” pieļautu to ko šī sieviete izdarīja manai meitai un man — tas pārsit visus manus korķus — un sanāk tā, ka šī xDraudzene ir nopietni par mani melojusi, gan sabiedrībā, gan policijai. 

Šī neiejaukšanās arī man liek secināt, ka nākotnes paaudzēm ir jāveic maiņa, ja vēlas, ka latviešu valoda, kultūra, sabiedrība, un valsts vispāri spētu pastāvēt. 

Paldies Dievam, to maiņu manu tīneidžera paaudzē. 

Palieku pie tā, ka atbalstīt daždažādu paveida varmācību, mantu piesavināšanu, un bērnu traumēšanu — nav “normāli,” un tas ir ko šīs xDraudzenes “draugu loks,” vai nu apzināti, vai neapzināti, dara. 

Vari arī tagad apsegtā sarunā (pousts nav publisks), pateikt, ka iet runa arī par diviem — un itsevišķi vienu — aizdomīgu nāves gadījumu. 

Man ļoti nepatīk, ka neatradu sabiedrības atbalstu normāli, labvēlīgi, savstarpēji cieņpilni šīs attiecības noslēgt. Tas man bija ļoti svarīgi. 

Bet laikam tiek slēptas viena vai vairākas jā/nē atbildes — un tāda veida “withholding,” veicināt — cilvēki, kas piemēram, rīko “vīriešu sadziedāšanas,” umm — vīriešiem???

Vīrieši aizstāv patiesiskumu un labvēlību. Vīrieši ir sargi. Šo pieļaut nevar neviens vīrietis, un tie, kas detaļas zin — un meklē vainu manī — lai gan, piemēram: atdot man savas mantas — ir absurdi elementāra un saprotama rīcība — nu tie nav vīrieši. Viņi ir varmācības un kriminālrīcību eneibleri — un viņu ietekme nopietni apdraud bērnu labklājību — un vēl tur uz pasākumiem iet ar bērniem. 


“Attiecīgi, šādus tekstus var uztvert kā Tavus centienus nodarboties ar virtue signalling jeb tēlot labāku kā esi, vai ka esi ļoti "needy", vai nevainīgā upura tēlošanu = ka Tev ir upura mentalitāte utt.”
Ja dvēsele vēlās nosaukt vīrieti par “needy,” kurš meklē atbildi uz jautājumu: vai bij bērniņš, tad ļoti gaidu, ka pēdīgi karmiskie rati šajsaulē iedarbotos. 

Tu to nedari, tikai skaidro, kā izskatās — bet nu — es ar vienu vīrieti čatoju — cenšoties noskaidrot vai viņš iespējams nebija šī bērniņa Tēvs — kamēr man uzbruka tie puiši RPP uniformās 2021. g. 16. oktobrī. Viņš neatbildēja un neatbildēja — mani nosauca par upurīti — teica, ka es tikai meklēju “vainīgo,” la la la la man esot jāizkāpj no upura lomas. Hello: vai Tu iespējams biji šī bērniņa Tēvs JĀ vai NĒ?

Latvijā esmu tagad saticis vairāk nekā vienu sievieti, kuras xPārtneris viņu sasita. Ko šīs sievietes dara? Meklē vainu sevī. Tas nav normāli. Te Latvijā pospadomju mentalitātē ir patiešām kropļota un izmainīta saprašana par cēloni un seku — par agresoriem un upuriem. 

“jeb centienus graut bijušās labo slavu, jeb atriebties par attiecību izjukšanu, vai ka esi nelīdzsvarots vajātājs un apmelotājs utt.”
Šīs xDraudzenes rīcības bija tik traumatizējošas, ka manai meitai bija jāiet tagad 2 gadus pie terapeites. 

Mana meita ir arī 2 vēstules aizrakstījusi Latvijas policijai, cenšoties aizstāvēt patiesību, un cenšoties nepieļaut šīs sievietes agresīvās melu kampaņas pret manīm turpināšanu. 

Iespējams, ka es sākšu publiski minēt gan datumus, klātesošo vārdus, un konkrētos notikumus. 

Sanāk šādi: es nedalos ar detaļām, ar faktiem, un ar vārdiem…jo man liekas pareizāk šādas lietas privāti nokārtot. Bet manas xDraudzenes rīcības ir kriminālas. Viņa par mani melo, un melo arī par manu meitu…gan publiski, gan iestādēm. 

Šī sieviete aizsūtīja bāriņtiesai apsūdzību, ka es iesaistot bērnus pieagušo cilvēku konfliktos. Manai meitai ir 17, un viņa pati iesaistījās, jo par manu meitu šī sieviete meloja — veidā kas nopietni maitā manu slavu — un kas ir licis cilvēkiem distancēties no manīm. 

Es patiešām ļaunāku uzvedību no līdzcilvēka šajsaulē nebūtu varējis iedomāties. Man ļoti patīk strādāt ar bērniem, muzicēt, vadīt sadziedāšanas un kreatīvus pasākumus — un man tagad sanāk vairāk nekā 10 gadu pieredze ar to ļoti skaistu nodarbošanos.

Šī sieviete to VISU saskaldināja. Tīšām. Ar meliem. 

Bet man pasaka: Daini, palaid, liec mieru la la la

Šī sieviete piedalījās pie nopietnas manas meitas traumatizēšanas, aiz manas muguras izplatīja tik indīgus melus, ka bars ar cilvēkiem no manīm distancējās un vairs nestrādāju ar viņu bērniem…neatbild vai bij bērniņš — un man esot jāliek mieru? Viņa ir normāla un varmācība ir pilnīgi OK — un man esot “jāpalaiž?”

“Katram pēc viņa samaitātības, protams, bet kāpēc gan visam rakstītam ticēt?”
Nu tamdēļ jau domāju, ka daži iesaistīsies — un to tagad daži ir izdarījuši. Bet, tas ka nav gūts sabiedrisks, savstarpējs atbalsts — ka “draugu loks” pieļauj nopietnu varmācību — tas patiešām spēj dvēseli graut.

It kā likās, ka esam viens otra palīgi, nevis sabotētāji.  

Ieskatīšos Tavā ieteiktā literatūrā — bet man ir skaidrs, ka Tu dažas detaļas patiešām nezini. Itsevišķi par to, kas notikās manai meitai, un šīs x”Draudzenes” iesaisti. 











Edvīns P. Rasiņš vari līdz 2024. g. 7. jūnijam 17os atbildēt, vai esi ar mieru nākt uz taisnīgu fizisku cīņu. Aptuveni šādi to iedomājos: katrs noliek 1T eiro, pludmalē ap mums ievelkam apli -- kurš otru izstums, vai ja otrs piecelties nevarēs, tas saņems otra 1T. Cīņa notiktos kkad jūlijā, jo man būs uz kādu laiciņu jāceļo. Vienīgais, jāparaksta, ka "tapping out" respektēs, bet arī, ka nāve var būt šo cīņu rezultāts -- un ka to pieņem -- un ka legālas sekas par otra nejaušo nogalināšanu nebūtu.





Artis Ruža Saprotu un apsveru ko iesaki. Te Latvijā ir ļoti izteikts spiediens "turēt visu sevī." It kā citu "problēmas" apgrūtinātu pārējos -- ja tikai par viņām runā. 

Jā, šī bijusī drošvien būtu mani vairāk "cienījusi," ja būtu varmāka. 

Bet neesmu. 

Ciešu - jā. Un lai katrs kas mani uzskata par "nūģi" (es nezinu ko tas nozīmē), katrs kas domā ka es te "vaimanāju," un ka man esot jātiek galā ar dzīvi -- lai tiem piesienas 100x tā pati enerģija ar kuru tiku konfrontēts -- tā pati postīšana -- tā pati varmācība -- tāda paša apmelošana utt. bet reiz vismaz 10. 

Esmu arī šokā, ka daloties ar šādām ziņām -- NEVIENS negriezās pret šo bijušo xDraudzeni (vai samaksātu vīriešu postītāju) un nesaka viņai: tā tā lieta neiet. Atbildi sirsnīgi un ticami vai bij bērniņš, atbildi par Tavām rīcībām 2021. g. 1.-2. aprīlī - un atdod viņam SAVAS mantas. 

To NEVIENS nedara -- un tas rāda uz to, ka mūsu sabiedrība ir saplīsusi. Neesmu publiski atklājis kādas varmācības saistās ar šo gadījumu -- un jā jā -- Daini, turi muti, apklusti, izbeidz čīkstēt. 

Ja šāda veida situācijas nespējam labvēlīgi nokārtot, tad latviešu tautai nākotnes nav. Tas ir 100% loģisks secinājums, un pieņemu, ka šīs xDraudzenes "tuvinieki" to arī saprot - tātad viņiem ir vienalga, ja viņu bērni izcieš tikpat ļaunu

One of the most liberating realizations you can have is that you are only responsible for your own actions, thoughts, and feelings. It's crucial to understand that other people's behavior, choices, and reactions are their responsibility, not yours. Learning to say, "That's on you," is a powerful way to set healthy boundaries and protect your own emotional well-being.
When someone behaves poorly or makes choices that negatively affect their life, it's easy to feel sympathy and even guilt, wondering if you could have done something differently. However, it's essential to remember that every individual is accountable for their own actions. You can offer support and guidance, but ultimately, they must choose their path and face the consequences of their decisions. By internalizing this, you empower yourself and others to take ownership of their lives.
Recognizing what belongs to you and what doesn't is a key aspect of maintaining your emotional health. Absorbing the pain and problems of others can be incredibly draining and can hinder your ability to focus on your own growth and happiness. It's important to develop a clear sense of boundaries, understanding where your responsibilities end and someone else's begin. This doesn't mean you stop caring or become indifferent; rather, it means you can offer empathy and support without losing yourself in the process.
When you stop absorbing others' pain and start recognizing what belongs to you, you create space for your own emotions and experiences. This allows you to better manage your own life, make healthier choices, and maintain a positive outlook. It also encourages others to take responsibility for their actions, fostering growth and maturity in them as well.
Learning to say, "That's on you," is a form of self-respect. It means valuing your own well-being enough to not let others' actions and emotions dictate your mental and emotional state. It empowers you to stand firm in your boundaries, ensuring that you are not unduly influenced or harmed by the behaviors and choices of others.
Moreover, this mindset promotes a healthier dynamic in relationships. It encourages open and honest communication, where each person takes responsibility for their part. This leads to more balanced and respectful interactions, where both parties can grow and thrive independently and together.
In essence, embracing the mantra, "That's on you," fosters personal accountability and emotional freedom. It allows you to live authentically, focusing on what you can control and letting go of what you cannot. This approach leads to a more peaceful, empowered, and fulfilling life, where you can support others without sacrificing your own well-being. So, stand firm in your boundaries, recognize what belongs to you, and let go of what doesn't. Your life will be richer and more rewarding for it.




what fake victims are exploiting is the compassion that real victims deserve


 I have been praying and meditating deeply, and it's starting to seem like "passing off" the consequences of "my sin" to Christ, is just the wrong thing to do. I am less and less interested in having had Christ die for my sins, the more I think through what our world would be like, if we just help perpetrators to account, instead of looping around in an endless cycle of perpetration and forgiveness.

that’s for me!

Michellesecret1 ok, since you create your own reality, that means you are writing what i am commenting to you. you are literally directly manifesting that this message is coming to you through you -- because i am just a mirror of you. i actually don't exist. only you exist (which isn't narcissistic at all). 

that being communicated to yourself through the you that is me: you are flat out wrong about people "creating their own realities." 

we are not "all one" and we live in a shared reality -- though we do create experiences for one another. 

other people besides you -- do exist. 

glad that you could help yourself through me today.

Brittney’s song…for Mark



Ģirts Laube Autentiski izprotot varmākas lomu, jā, šis puisis ar spēku parāda kuri ir upuri, kuri ir varmākas, un sniedzas pēc glābēja gan sevī, gan glābējiem pasaulē. 

I don't credit mass-murder and carpet bombing with generating "diamonds," and I am certain that he would much rather have never experienced war. 

Saprotu Tavu domu, Ģirt, bet nu, te Latvijā tik ļoti







Dear Isaiah, 

I saw your video and spoke to my friend Davids Klavins, who makes the world’s only vertical concert grand pianos. He agreed to raise his standard referral commission from 3% to 5% just for you, for you to save your childhood home. 

Of course, the donation relies on the network of goodwill you’ve created finding one or more clients who would purchase Klavins Pianos (any make or model). 

This model: 
https://klavins-pianos.com/products/model-450i/

is the largest piano in the world, and builds start at 3.5 million dollars. 5% of that is 175k, which could take you a few steps further in saving your childhood home. 

The clients just need to mention your name when making their purchases, and you will receive 5% through the end of June 2024. 

Wishing you strength in your struggle!

Best, 
Dainis W. Michel and the Klavins Pianos Team

Hi, you are aware that FIS is trying to steal my tuition money by perpetrating fraud, discrimination, and sabotage, right?


I'm sorry to hear about your concerns. Could you please provide more details about the situation with FIS and how it's affecting your tuition payment?

Sure, here is my submission to the police, just a second...


I understand you're concerned about how the situation with FIS is affecting your tuition payment. One possible interpretation of your query is that you're inquiring about changes to your loan repayment terms due to a change in your school program duration. If this is the case, it's important to note that once a loan has been funded, the repayment terms are set and cannot be changed unless the school communicates otherwise. If this does not address your concern, could you please provide more details about the FIS situation you're referring to? Are you experiencing issues with payment processing or communication from FIS regarding your tuition payment?

Answer



dwm_Studen...m 2023.pdf


Thanks for sending that. Can you also describe the issue for me?

do you have my charges submitted to the police?


Could you please provide more details about your experience with FIS and how it has impacted your tuition payment?

yes, Rachel Katz, an instructor at FIS is responsible for instructor-perpetrated discrimination, bullying, and sabotage.


I understand you're bringing up a serious concern regarding Rachel Katz, an instructor at FIS. However, the information I've found about your query does not provide any details on individual instructors or their conduct. To better assist you, could you provide more context or specify the type of information you're seeking? Are you looking for resources on how to address discrimination and bullying in educational settings, or are you seeking assistance with a specific situation involving Climb Credit's services?

Answer


of course. Rachel Katz has lied and can be expected to continue to lie about my performance and conduct at FIS


I understand you're facing a challenging situation, but the information I've found does not directly address issues related to personal employment matters or allegations of dishonesty by individuals. If your query is related to credit or financial services, could you please provide more details or context? This would help in giving you the most accurate information possible.

Ar šodienu brīvprātīgi, pēc savas apzinātas gribas, esmu kļuvis par Fidži nodokļu rezidentu un nomainījis arī mobilos sakarus. Turpmāk būšu sasniedzams tikai uz Fidži numuru (+679) 9762868, vislabāk Telegram un Whatsapp. Negribu vairs, ja godīgi, nekādu saistību ne ar SIA LV koloniālo korporāciju kā tādu, ne ar privātajām korporācijām, kas ekonomiski okupējušas mūsu Latviju.
Tālākais plāns ir nodibināt uzņēmumu, atvērt bankas kontu, nopirkt freehold (neapliekas ne ar kādiem nodokļiem, nodevām utt.) zemi ar mantošanas tiesībām paaudzēs un sākt projektēt mūsu pirmo ciematu, kur jau šogad ievākties pašiem un izmitināt pirmos atbraucējus. Mans galvenais uzdevums pašlaik ir pašam izrubties  cauri Fidži likumdošanai un sagatavot starta platformu priekš pārējiem. Dzīvesvieta ir svarīga, protams, bet daudz svarīgāk ir jau iepriekš saprast, ar ko profesionāli nodarboties ikdienā. Uzņēmējdarbībai, protams, šeit ir visfantastiskākās iespējas, bet arī dažādu jomu speciālistiem palīdzēsim  sevi realizēt Fidži.

Some facts about bamboo:
1.Fast Growth: Bamboo is the fastest-growing plant in the world. It has been recorded at growing 47.6 inches in 24 hours. Some species can even grow over a meter per day under optimal conditions. A new bamboo shoot reaches its full height in less than a year.
2. Oxygen Release: A grove of bamboo releases 35% more oxygen than any other tree out there.
3. Carbon Dioxide Absorption: Bamboo absorbs carbon dioxide at a rate of 17 tons per hectare every year. It can act as a valuable carbon sink given how fast the plant grows.
4. No Fertilizer Required: Bamboo doesn’t need fertilizer to grow. It can self-mulch by dropping its leaves and use the nutrients to grow.
5. Drought Resistance: Bamboos are drought-tolerant plants. They can grow in the desert.
6. Wood Replacement: Bamboos can be harvested in 3-5 years compared to the 20-30 years of most softwood trees.
7. Building Material: Bamboo is incredibly strong and sturdy. It has been used as support for concrete as well as scaffolding, bridges, and houses.
8. Soil Stability: Bamboo has a wide network of underground roots and rhizomes that prevent soil erosion.
9. Natural Air Conditioner: Bamboo cools the air surrounding it by up to 8 degrees in the summer.
10. Invasiveness: Some species of bamboo, especially ‘running’ bamboos, can be invasive due to their extensive root systems, which allow them to spread rapidly. However, not all species are invasive, and with proper management, the environmental impact can be minimized.

piedodi, mīļā meitiņ, bet es tik ļoti negribētu, ka Tu pastāvīgi dzīvotu Austrijā — te ir noticis tik daudz launuma, un Tava māte šodien solīja mani iznīcināt, to destroy me utt utt — un es nezinu kāpēc cilvēks, kuram es gādāju, aizdevu, izturēju ka viņa man sit, ka piekrāpj, ka viņa piekrāpa Austrijas valdību — kā viņai var būt tiesības pār Tevi? KĀ? 

Its not fair. 

un tagad Tu laikam patiešām gribi šajā valstī būt — lai gan te tikām terorizēti…

Charlie Chaplin once told a joke in front of an audience..!!
Everyone laughed
And he told it a second time, so only a few laughed.
When he told it for the third time, no one laughed.
Then he said beautiful words.
If you can't laugh and laugh at the same joke, why do you cry and cry at the same pain and sorrow?
So enjoy every moment of your life - Charlie Chaplin left a great legacy without saying a word or hurting anyone's feelings. We remember these phrases that touch the heart.
*** Nothing in this life is permanent, not even our Problems.
*** I love walking in the rain so no one can see my tears.
*** The day you waste the most in your life is the day you don't laugh.

Relevant screenshots of conversations you had with Rachel on Discord or email.
Communications or recordings of your Phase 2 1:1 Assessment Retake meeting on 3/29 with Rachel
Written explanation and screenshots of the work you contributed to your Phase 2 group project.

FIS has not addressed ANY of the concerns in my “grievance.” 

FIS has been issued a notice of breach of contract, and you are apparently, currently, doing something called gaslighting. 

You are claiming: 

To review your grievance, we need you to supply supportive documentation of your claims regarding unfair treatment, lack of educational standards, inability to receive assessment feedback, and concerns related to Rachel's treatment with you. 
I already sent you what happened. 

The unfair treatment is that Rachel claimed that my grade was 61% even though I had done all of the assignments. All of them. I had completed all of the homework, all of the quizzes, all of the labs, and both group projects. 

FIS refusing to acknowledge Rachel’s unfair bullying and abuse of her authority as an instructor — is the problem. 

Rachel requiring that I verbally code in React — which NO ONE in the cohort can do — and I offered 5 fellow students either $50 or $100 USD to do what Rachel asked me to do — and none of them responded affirmatively and one even wrote to me the he/she doubts any of us could do what Rachel asked me to do — that is the problem. 

FIS has the list of Rachel’s abuse of authority — and not letting me continue in the cohort is also evidence of her abuse of authortiy. 

Writing to me, sometimes anonymously, and sometimes with a first name “Renata,” is also not adequate remediation on your the part of FIS. 

FIS needs NONE of the following: 
	•	Relevant screenshots of conversations you had with Rachel on Discord or email.
	•	Communications or recordings of your Phase 2 1:1 Assessment Retake meeting on 3/29 with Rachel
	•	Written explanation and screenshots of the work you contributed to your Phase 2 group project.
Regarding: 
	•	Relevant screenshots of conversations you had with Rachel on Discord or email.
I did not record her abuse of power moments. I had been to an open casket funeral and cremation the day before. I had done an entire alternate project while weeping — all night. Rachel did this off camera and turned on the camera to record while I was grief stricken and unable to even speak. It was incredibly unfair of Rachel and her abuse of her authority as an instructor was deeply inappropriate. 

	•	Communications or recordings of your Phase 2 1:1 Assessment Retake meeting on 3/29 with Rachel
No — she recorded every once in a while while I was unable to speak and just wanted to cry. Her bullying was horrific and I did not record it. She did — apparently right when she knew I’d be unable to answer her — her behavior was deeply inappropriate and I would dismiss a teacher who does that to students — immediately. 

	•	Written explanation and screenshots of the work you contributed to your Phase 2 group project.




Regarding your second claim, which is that this statement:

“If you think a good handful of students have better skills than i do - they don’t – at all – i have worked with them and talked with them.”
constitutes a CoC violation. 

Let’s examine your claim. 

It is 100% true. 
None of the other students were asked to be able to verbally code in React. 
Verbally coding in React without notes is not on any syllabus or list of requirements anywhere
I verified my statement by asking 5 of my colleagues, if they would like to try to do what Rachel asked me to do, privately. I offered them either $50 or $100 USD, if they could verbally code in React — none of them responded affirmatively and none of them even tried
One student (who will remain anonymous to protect him/her from Rachel’s bullying), wrote to me that he also believes that no one in the cohort could do what Rachel asked me to do. 

So, therefore, my statement “If you think a good handful of students have better skills than i do - they don’t – at all – i have worked with them and talked with them,” is a statement of fact — and NOT a CoC violation. 

So far, we have cleared up: 

1) In the course of pleading with Rachel to understand basic human decency regarding honoring my time of bereavement — and since she was either refusing to understand, or incapable of understanding, the human need for a time of mourning — I used the word “sh*t” with a star for the “i” — in the context of Rachel having made clear that she was cool with the use of “foul” language in cohort communications — especially on Feelings Fridays. That is NOT a CoC violation. 

2) Factually stating that the other students can’t verbally code in React the way Rachel asked me to - is also NOT a CoC violation. 

3) Also, as someone who has taught over 3,000 adults various subjects, telling a young coding teacher “Rachel, you really don’t teach,” is absolutely fair. She doesn’t. She shows off her skills and steamrolls students with up to hundreds of new vocabulary words per lecture. She does not concentrate on teaching — which is a different activity than showing. With a few days of preparation, I could easily present the same lectures Rachel presents — because she does not teach, she shows. My goal in communicating with Rachel and FIS is to improve the school, Rachel’s teaching, the student experience, and the efficacy of FIS grads on the job market. My constant goal is to enjoy, improve, help, and assist. Rachel NEEDS this critique, because some of her former students really wound up in states of crisis. Reach out to the students who dropped out of just my cohort - read some of the evaluations of FIS online - if Rachel would take accountability for her teaching style - and learn and provide education and growth — while allowing herself to grow and learn - then she would be able to impact many students in a much more positive way. So clearly, that statement is not and cannot be considered a CoC violation. 

FIS will withdraw its accusations and the new cohort teacher will sign a statement that he/she will provide fair education without discrimination, bullying, or sabotage. 

If FIS is unwilling to provide me with fair education without discrimination, bullying, or sabotage, then you are to return my entire tuition amount to me personally, by the end of this week. 

Best, 
Dainis W. Michel

Andri, Dievs mani ar Emīti no šīs siguldietes nepasargāja. 

Kamdēļ?

Bez šīs x”Draudzenes” visticamāk Latvijā strādātu ar bērniem, iespējams diriģētu vienu vai vairākus korus, būtu labas attiecības ar folkloras mūzikantiem utt…

Esam Austrijā — dēļ šīs sievietes meliem. Esmu visā visumā no Latvijas izraidīts, nepieņemts, un apmelots. 







Jo Emīte daļēji ir sākusi pie savas mātes dzīvot, gāju piekopt xSievas dzīvokli. Vineta, ir piedzīvojumi kas izraisa dziļu dziļu šoku...Emītes māte bija atļāvusi viņas divām mīļām žurciņām -- nedēļu -- brīvu dzīvošanu Emītes istabā. Tīšām atstāja būrīti vaļā. Ēdiena standziņas izlika Emītes istabas stūrīšos. Viss, Vineta, viss bija piekakāts, jaunās kurpes sakostas utt utt. Visu satīrīju, bet ļoti smirdēja.

LinkedIn banned my original profile after I translated a panel discussion from English into Latvian in which doctors and scientists (and OSHA specialists) discussed mask-wearing. 

I made a new one to fulfill the FlatIron assignment requirements but I just re-vamped my appeal for them to reinstate my original account: https://dainis.net/linkedin/

This brought up some post-traumatic stress for me, because I wrote a letter to the Latvian Ministry of Health asking them to mathematically verify that there was a pandemic or epidemic in Latvia at the beginning of the covid affair. As a result, I was targeted for severe police brutality and nearly killed. 

Since I've been kicked out of more than one institution and lost more than one job, either directly or indirectly due to what I can best describe as "having read the methods sections of scientific medical literature" and refusing to be silenced regarding incredibly obvious facts, it actually makes me a bit nervous regarding my status at FlatIron to share my history with LinkedIn. 

I clearly won't work for companies like LinkedIn, FaceBook, or YouTube, but there are plenty of ethical companies that need Software Architecture and Software Engineering. 

I'm really enjoying the BootCamp and hope I'll be allowed to continue, even if I am a publicly recognized medical human rights advocate. 

Best, 
Dainis

React differentiates between a component and a regular DOM element based on capitalization. For example, making an `` component with a lowercase name wouldn't work:

function article() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>React</h1>
      <p>Component</p>
    </div>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(<article />, document.getElementById("root"));
Trying to render this component would result in React rendering an`` HTML elementLinks to an external site.instead of the `` component.

Using an uppercase name for the function fixes this problem:

function Article() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>React</h1>
      <p>Component</p>
    </div>

Skaidrīte Kudiņa neiešu ratā. Ārstiem bija jāaizstāv individuālās medicīniskās tiesības un bija jāspēj atšķirt absurdi transparenti viltotu informāciju no zinātnieciskās realitātes kvafēras laikā.

Tāpat, kā šajā sarunā sastopamies ar izaicinājumu atšķirt maldinošas filozofijas no izpalīdzīgām, praktiskā ziņā, Latvijas ārstu atbildība bija:

* spēt atšķirt viltotos RT-PCR testus (kurus izveidoja ārsts, kurš savu disertāciju viltoja), no lietderīgām indikācijām

* spēt atšķirt viltotos slimības cēloņus no īstiem

* būt zinātnieciski drosmīgiem un kompetentiem diezgan vaicāt "vai patiešām patogēniski vīrusi eksistē piem. cilvēka šūnās vai ķermeņa šķidrumos?" -- vai te tikai tautu māna ar datorsimulācijām un pilnīgi korumpētu "zinātni?"

* vismaz meklēt patiesību diezgan palasīt un izvērtēt viroloģijas zinātniecisko literatūru, piem kurā apgalvo, ka ar fekāliju injekcijām peļu smadzenēs it kā "pierādīja" poliomelīša lipīgumu utt utt utt -- nu vismaz izlasīt kādus zinātniecisko pētījumu methods sections...

...pat pielietojot novecojušo viroloģijas modeli: nevienam zinātnieciski kompetentam ārstam nevajadzēja ieteikt vai aizstāvēt, vai pieļaut masku valkāšanas uzspiešanu sabiedriskās vietās. Nevienam zinātniekam, nevienam ārstām, nevajadzēja tās muļķības aizstāvēt. 

Bija jāaizstāv patiesa zinātne, un pacientu individuālās medicīniskās cilvēktiesības sakarā ar maskām, injekcijām, un citiem ierobežojumiem.

Ja to nedarījāt, varat mierīgi mani bloķēt.

"Ārsti" ir zaudējuši savu statusu, kā uzticāma sabiedrības daļa - itsevišķi skatoties uz pēc-injekciju mirstības, slimošanas un dzemdības statistiku. 

Esmu Šaolin medicīnas pasniedzējs un izmācījos high-volume medical data analysis un sistēmu zinātni kvafēras laikā. Mani pakalpojumi, līdz šim, ir bijuši bezmaksas...un visai veiksmīgi...mani bērnības draugi (kas kļuva par ārstiem), man sūta pacientus, kad nezin kā tālāk...

Pacientus mīl, viņus sargājot -- aizstāvot -- un palīdzot uz zinātnieciski patiesiem, nevis viltotiem pamatiem. 

Skatoties uz Jūsu pamata filozofijām, iespējams ka nebūsiet vēl pat salīdzinājusi dīgsnes un vides teorijas. 

Esat izlasījusi Dr. Mark Bailey "A Farewell to Virology?"

https://drsambailey.com/a-farewell-to-virology-expert-edition/

Ļoti ceru, ka kļūdos, bet uz atvērtām sarunām, kas jau no sākuma nečubina Jūsu ego-centrisko "dzīve ir Tavs spogulis" modeli, Jūs neliekaties gatava -- un esat jau -- un tas izriet no šāda veida filozofijām, ar mieru būt emocionāli varmācīga (vismaz ar svešinieku onlainā). 

Jautājums ir: vai Jūs ļausiet šai varmācībai augt, vai to nokārtosiet?

Būtībā "Dzīve ir Tavs spogulis," Tevi kaitina manī to kas Tev kaitina sevī, upuri pievelk varmākas utt utt utt -- tie ir ļoti primitīvi varmāku/psihopātu/sociopātu/narcisistu triki, lai upuri vainotu sevi. 

Es pieņēmu, Skaidrīte -- ar tik skaistu vārdu -- nav ar Jums bezcerīgi -- bet nu -- ja mākat angļu valodu, vismaz izlasiet to Farewell to Virology expert edition report...

Un "ejiet nu ratā," ir emocionāla varmācība...tātad...nu varbūt piekopjiet to. Izkāpjiet no šo moderno ezoGuru trakuma mākoņa...

Par Jums Dievam lūgšu...neliekas bezcerīgi jo pilnīgi "aizgājusi" Jūs neesat...bet nu...patiešām...ir cilvēki kuri neiztur patiesu zinātni...viņi kļūst agresīvi un traki...ja tāda esat...tad mierīgi mani nobloķējiet, nelasiet methods sections, neverificējiet šarlatāņ"zinātnieku" uzspiestās muļķības utt utt...

Aaaaaa...pirms beidzu...Dr. Mark Bailey sieva ir arī ārste...viņa saucās Dr. Sam Bailey. Viņa ir ļoti simpātiska, smaidīga sieviete -- varbūt ja šāda veida info nāk no zinošas, skaistas, izglītotas sievietes un daudzbērnu mammas -- Jums tas liksies mazāk kā konfrontācija, un vairāk kā aicinājums.

How can we gain a better understanding of the full scope of the content we'll be covering in the whole bootcamp, along with what information we will be tested on and required to know?

Eye strain is really messing with me. I already purchased speechify to read the online content to me --- that helps. The thing is I have 40/20 vision and apparently when I concentrate, my eyes really really "focus in," so when we're coding, I go into "precise concentration" mode and my eyes are really hurting and watering a lot. I already made a tiktok about the matter and am curious if blogging about reducing the eye strain that results from excessive screen time would count as a blogging topic for the program.

A book called
The Imperfection of God
Meeting Mistakes With Compassion



Un tad, viņa aizgāja uz spēka un apzinātības elpošanas un dejošanas kursiem un pēc tam sameklēja ļoti jauku vīrieti, kas itin nekad viņai nedarītu pāri — un izēda viņam dvēseli, traumatizēja viņa meitu, un vēl par šo vīrieti sabiedrībā tik intensīvi un ļaunsirdīgi meloja, ka viņam grieza cilvēki muguru — bariem. Visu viņas sakrāto naidu pret vīriešiem un pret xVīra, viņa izgāza uz labsirdīga vīrieša, kas nebija pelnījis viņas ļaunumu. 


Skaisti, Edgar -- spēku un izturību visiem tiem kas tur mugurkaulu!!!


man nežēlīgi uzbruka…jā…paldies, Ainār, ka atceries! 


nu ja, ilgi gaidīsim, līdz kamēr "tautai" būtu savstarpēji labvēlīgas vērtības...būtu ļoti skaisti, ja dokumenti nebūtu vajadzīgi...bet "visupirms, sākumā, bija vārds…”

laikam “tautai” vajag vadlīnījas…




…noteikumi, pilsoņu tiesības, indivīdu tiesības...varas iestādēm piešķir autoritāti arī uzturēt satversmē formalizētās kopējās vērtības


nu ja, tikai dažus gadus Latvijā pašā dzīvojot, manī ir izveidojies cinisisms par latviešu spēju viens otru mīlēt un atbalstīt. ļoti skumji…

Nu tad uzrakstīsim kārtīgu, labu, tautai labvēlīgu satversmi!



Palieku pie rakstītā, vīri būtu palīdzējuši man atgūt manas mantas no Ligijas. Vīri būtu pastāvējuši uz to, ka sabiedriskā uzvedība ir cilvēciska, nevis ļauna. 

Aiz meliem seko melna diena. To jums vajadzētu šodien dziedāt. 

Ligija burtiski rādās manas meitas murgos — un Emītei ir bijusi terapija vajadzīga vairāk nekā gadu — lai atkoptos no traumatizējumiem, kuri bez Ligijas, nebūtu notikušies. 

Un pēc kā esmu sniedzies: pēc patiesības. 

Vai Ligija tīšām veicināja Emītes laupīšanu: jā/nē?

Skaidrības nav. 

Vai viņa abortēja vai zaudēja mūsu bērniņu: skaidrības nav. 

Un nevienam no jums vīriem nav par morālais mugurkauls stiprs diezgan, man palīdzēt no viņas atgūt manas mantas?

Vai Tu zināji, ka Ligija pat policijai ir melojusi tik absurdā līmenī, ka mana mamma smējās, kad viņai izlasīju ko Ligija par mani apgalvoja? Ligija policijai stāstīja, ka es pie viņas esot ieradies ar koferi pilnu ar mīkstiem dzīvniekiem. Hello, labdien…tas nenotikās. 

Ligija policijai iestāstīja, ka viņai bija ļoti dziļa saruna ar manu meitu — un Emīte policijai aizrakstīja — ka tā saruna nemaz nenotikās. Jo tā nenotikās!

Vīri neatļautu šāda veida nepatiesiskumu sabiedrības ikdienā. 

Es zinu, Sandri, Tu vismaz man patiesi atbildēji par attiecībām ar Ligiju — bet vienkārši palieku absolūtā šokā par šīs ļaužu grupas ļaunsirdības “mīlestības” un “gaismas cilvēku” aizsegā. 

Jo neviens, kurš detaļas zin par Ligijas uzvedību pret manīm un manu meitu, kam ir ētiska/mīļa/patiesa dvēsele, nevarētu vienkārši stāvēt malā un nedarīt nekā. 

Es ceru arī, ka Tu izjūti un saproti: bez abpusējas vēlmes, nevēlējos attiecības ar Ligiju turpināt, viss ok…bet neizskaidrot viņas līdzdalību vistraumatizējošākā notikumā manas meitas dzīvē? Neizrunāt to, kas starp mums palika neizrunāts — un neatbildēt ticami/patiesi par bērniņu? 

Mēs nezinām kad Ligija melo, kad stāsta patiesību par mūsu iespējamo bērniņu — kuram bijām jau pārrunājuši vārdus — vairākus mēnešus. Vai bija spontānaborts, tīšs aborts, vai mēnešiem mānījās par bērniņu un rādīja uz 4-mēnešu puncīti un pārrunājām ar Rūtiņu bērniņa vārdus — un viņa mānījās? Tie visi bija meli ieskaitot viņas ķermeņu maiņas, ādas maiņa, krūšu maiņa, gūžu maiņa un tauku maiņa — tātad agrā grūtniecība bija feik? 

Iedomājies: normāli un ticami atbildēt, un lieta būtu atbildēta — bet Ligija vēl tur manas mantas pie sevīm — un ļoti nozīmīgas un manai dvēselei vajadzīgas atbildes — no manīm attur. Tas ir ļauni. Neatbildēt. Viņa zin. Es ne. 

Es bez jokiem Dievam lūdzu lai visu vīriešu dzimtu no viņas pasargātu…un lai sievietes turētos patiešām no viņas tālu prom…jo aiz viņas viltīgās enerģijas seko posts un traumatizēijumi no kuriem ne visi spēj atkopties. 

Bet tik melni par mani melot — tā, ka esmu ticis bloķēts un ka zaudēju bērnu grupas ar kurām strādāju — ka man ir nākuši tik absurdi pārmetumi par manu pagātni FBā — ka vienkārši nav saptrotams kamdēļ Ligija tāāā par mani melotu. 

Es to nebiju pelnījis, ka mani apmelo un izraida — ka manu meitu traumatizē — un ka neviens veiksmīgi nepalīdzētu. 

Ja šiem “vīriem” gadās graujošs/postošs nepatiesiskums jūsu dzīves ceļos — itsevišķi tiem, kas zin par to, ko ar savu meitu un mammu pārdzīvojām Siguldas “draugu” lokā — un neviens neko nedara lietas labā — nu tad tā būtu pareizā karmiskā atbilde. 





ooooh 
ooooh
ooooh, happy birthday to you
ooooh, happy birthday to you

Sometimes people say 
Growing up is hard to do
But it’s really fun
If we get to hang out with you

ooooh, happy birthday to you
ooooh, happy birthday to you

and then one day
a spark of grace
took human form
and you were born

Music: (chaos — harmony)
humble and caring
peaceful and daring

Es Tevi
Es Tevi
mīlu

Sometimes people say 
Growing old is hard to do
But it’s really fun
If we get to hang out with you

Sometimes people say 
The school of life is hard to get through
But it’s really fun
If we get to hang out with you


For those of you considering blaming yourselves — do. 






Esmu ticis šajā Coding Skolā: https://flatironschool.com/

Piespiedu podziņu, un kvalificējos kredītam…bet līdz šim tikai tuition maksai…tur ir arī Living Expenses opcija…un tā nav apstiprināta. 

Emītei ir dz. diena 28. janvārī…ļoti ļoti ļoti stingri Dievam lūdzu, lai visas finanses izdotos. Kamēr bijām kopā LV, kā ierasts, lietas salikās…onlaina mūzikas students pieteicās utt…naudiņas visam vienmēr ir, ja Emītei vajag…




Tuvākā laikā izsūtīšu konservatorijām un universitātēm vēstuli no mums…pieņemu, ka rezultāti būs…jautājums ir tikai, kad. 

Ļoti intensīvi Dievam lūdzu, lai finanses būtu nodrošinātas šim Vīnes braucienam. Bet nav un diemžēl jūtos ļoti nospiests. 

Kaut kādīgi mani centieni, projekti…esmu nonācis devēja lomā…tik dikti…ka tagad…pašam trūkst. 

Ļoti intensīvi neērta man situācija…labu domādams Dievam lūgdams tagad LeSAEp projekts ir stāvējis gandrīz mēnesi neskārts. Sakārtoju sūtīšanu Tev, Klavins Piano, ok…bet nu…kad man pēdīgi atkal būs adekvātas peļņas? Vai šī xSievas un xDraudzenes ietekme nevarētu

Gigi, my xWife has owed me child support for 11 years — paid 0 — no one cares…and the story just gets worse and worse…and I have done soooo much in courts — and the police actually have mostly been really helpful…







at first i did not think i could “find” guilt, but as i feel in — i mean if i am so unworthy such a good target for abuse — then maybe i am guilty — especially the Law of Attraction stuff — it really really hurts when I hear that stuff…like I “attracted” what I experienced — and if I did - then I am “guilty,” ok — how horrible…i guess i can go down such a cycle…






Thank you, Serenity, I have been crying since this webinar started. Pretty severe cramping in my stomach, too…it’s healing but the trauma was very powerful. 


Kaylee you look like exactly the kind of person that “makes” the dinner table at social events a pleasant place for everyone. Thank you just for your resonance.

Assault under the color of authority




Tieši domāju, par to, ka biju par vienu kursu samaksājis, bet tagad skatoties…ePasti nonāca spamā…un telegrama ziņas patiešām zem diģitāliem kalniem kaut kur slēpjās. 

Tagad sataisīju jaunu epasta iekārtu — un pirmo reizi vairākos mēnešos, redzu ziņu no Tevīm.

Ļoti gribēju Tevi un Tavu pieeju atbalstīt — bet sanāk tā — ka itin neko neguvu, neapskatījos, nepiedalījos…gribējās arī būt “pasīvākam,” jo taču esmu maksātāja lomā…it kā pakalpojumam būtu bijis jānāk manā virzienā…ne ka man jāpūlās un jāuzbāžās…

Laikam kurss jau bija sācies, ne man SMS ziņas nāca…ne man zvanīja…

Piem, kursa sākumā, dalībniekiem varbūt varēja būt 15-30 min telefona saruna…pateikt kur kas kā kad…




I have a few projects and really, maybe just self-funding is the right way to go...but a few of my inventions really would require investment to launch successfully. But the process of seeking investment takes a tremendous amount of time...

In other country no one care what written on package…it say “candies for kids” and inside is moldy sock strips fermented in sugar sauce — it’s ok — kids eat artificially colored radioactive waste puffs crunchies with big smile

In Latvia what on package must be in package. All food good in Latvia. You buy garlic clove and bring home and it brown - you bring back to store and get money back and post on internet. You buy rotten avocado — you post on internet and threaten to burn down store. You buy potato and it say grown in Latvia, you bring home and it not good potato you post on internet they sell me italian potato and said it was Latvian potato i boil potato and can even taste the carbonara — we go burn down store. Half internet in riot because store say Italian potato is Latvian potato. 
But if in Internet it say: Latvia is a representative parliamentary democratic republic — and it isn’t — no one care go home and read newspaper.
