Dear IPTC Team,

Your excellent research on metadata preservation across social platforms highlights the critical issue that DA1's metaMetadata system addresses. 

We've developed a universal metadata translation layer that ensures attribution persists even when files move through platforms that strip embedded data. Our approach complements IPTC standards by creating a parallel attribution system that survives platform transitions.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how DA1 can work with IPTC standards to create more robust attribution for photographers and visual artists. Our system could potentially provide additional metrics for your platform testing initiative.

Dear David,

Your "monkey selfie" case highlights the devastating impact that loss of attribution can have on photographers' livelihoods. I believe DA1's technology could have made a difference in your situation.

Our metaMetadata system creates a persistent layer of attribution that would have maintained your connection to the image regardless of where it was shared. This creates legally verifiable evidence of authorship that persists even when embedded metadata is stripped.

I'd be interested in discussing how our technology could help protect your current and future work, and potentially exploring a case study that could help other photographers avoid similar situations.

Dear Brewster,

Your work with the Internet Archive has been pioneering in digital preservation, and I noted your comments about metadata being as important as the content itself.

DA1's metaMetadata system creates a persistent attribution layer that ensures creator metadata survives even when content moves through platforms that strip embedded data. This aligns perfectly with the Archive's mission of preserving digital heritage in its complete context.

I believe there could be valuable synergies between our approaches to metadata persistence. Would you be interested in exploring how DA1's technology might complement the Internet Archive's preservation work?

With respect for your groundbreaking work,

Dear Dr. Towse,

Your research on the economic impact of metadata problems in creative industries has been foundational to understanding the scale of this issue.

DA1 has developed a metaMetadata system that addresses the problems you've identified by creating a persistent attribution layer that ensures creator metadata survives even when content moves through platforms that strip embedded data.

We're seeing early evidence of significant economic recovery for creators, which aligns with your findings on potential revenue improvement. I believe there could be an interesting research opportunity to quantify the economic impact of our solution.

Would you be interested in discussing a potential research collaboration to measure the economic effects of persistent metadata attribution?
