Dear Fred,

Your insights on metadata as the infrastructure of attribution in the digital economy resonate deeply with our mission at DA1.

We've developed a metaMetadata system that ensures attribution persists throughout the content lifecycle, even when moving through platforms that strip embedded data. This maintains the crucial connection between creators and their work that you've identified as essential for the creative ecosystem.

Given your experience investing in creator platforms and Web3 infrastructure, I believe you would have valuable perspective on our approach. Would you be interested in a brief overview of our solution?

Learn more at da1.fm/chat.html or I'm happy to schedule a conversation.

Best regards,

Dear RIAA Metadata Initiative Team,

Your statement on metadata integrity being essential to the digital music ecosystem aligns perfectly with DA1's mission.

Our metaMetadata system ensures attribution data persists throughout the content lifecycle, even when music moves through platforms that strip embedded data. This directly addresses the billions in misallocated royalties your initiative aims to solve.

I believe there could be valuable opportunities for alignment between our technology and the RIAA's Metadata Initiative. Would your team be interested in learning more about our implementation approach?
